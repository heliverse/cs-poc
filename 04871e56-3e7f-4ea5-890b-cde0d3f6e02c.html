 <h2 id =chapter-1 > Chapter 1</h2> <p id = > At Riverdale Public Hospital.</p>  <p id = > “Excuse me, make way!” Philip Clarke was carrying an unconscious little girl as he rushed into the hospital, yelling madly, “Doctor! Doctor! Quick, save my little girl!”</p>  <p id = > The nurses and doctor who had rushed out quickly took the child from Philip’s arms, and entered the emergency room.</p>  <p id = > “Oh, you can’t go in!” A nurse in an azure-colored uniform with a face mask stopped Philip from entering into the emergency room.</p>  <p id = > Just then, the rapid sounds of high heels clicking against the ceramic tiles could be heard from the back, squeezing his heart with every click.</p>  <p id = > “Philip Clarke!” roared a woman’s voice.</p>  <p id = > ‘Slap!’</p>  <p id = > A crisp slap came in firm contact with Philip’s cheek. Before him, stood Wynn Johnston with an enraged expression as tears pooled in her beautiful eyes. “If anything happens to my daughter,I will never forgive you!” Her tone was cold and laced with full fury.</p>  <p id = > This scene frightened quite a few patients and their family members in the hospital.</p>  <p id = > Philip hung his head low in shame without attempting any explanation.</p>  <p id = > “Hmph!” Wynn snorted coldly. The dissatisfaction and contempt in her eyes were visible.</p>  <p id = > Philip stood aside with his head down in silence like a kid who was caught misbehaving. He stole a few glances at the woman standing a few meters away from him, the woman he used to call his wife. The woman with whom he had already signed the divorce papers could officially be separated from him at any time.</p>  <p id = > Wynn Johnston was gorgeous. Her features were defined, her figure tall and slim. She was well-mannered and educated, once the prettiest girl in their university. She had unexpectedly fallen in love with Philip,abruptly gotten married, and given birth to his daughter, Mila Clarke.</p>  <p id = > However, life after marriage was not as ideal. Philip’s career did not go well, and his business ended up failing. His daughter even had congenital heart disease, which drained all of their savings, and now he had to make a living by doing food delivery services.</p>  <p id = > On the other hand, Wynn was a deputy general manager of a marketing department in a public-listed company. One of her parents was a section chief, the other a retired teacher.</p>  <p id = > It was safe to say that Philip did not have much status in the Johnston family, and for the past two years, he was almost non-existent. And because of Philip, Wynn had fallen out with her family that her parents were not willing to provide them any support.Both the elders had told them solemnly that they would assist in their granddaughter’s treatment funds only if Philip and Wynn divorced. After the divorce, the child would belong to the Johnston family.</p>  <p id = > This matter had dragged on for a year.</p>  <p id = > The emergency room’s door was pushed open, and Philip saw his daughter being pushed out. He wanted to rush over, but Wynn had already gotten there first. He stopped in his tracks and watched his adorable little girl from afar.</p>  <p id = > Little Mila was wearing a respirator, but her big eyes were bright like obsidian gems. She reached out with her tiny pale hand and mumbled, “Papa…”</p>  <p id = > Philip went over to hold his daughter’s cold hand while gently brushing away the wisps of hair from her forehead, smiling as he said, “Papa’s here.”</p>  <p id = > “Mama, please don’t fight with Papa. It’s Mila’s fault;I wanted Papa to take me to the amusement park.” Little Mila, who was only three-years-old, was speaking feebly for her father.</p>  <p id = > Wynn smiled and answered, “Okay, Mama will listen to you and not argue with Papa.</p>  <p id = > “Philip Clarke, pay the hospitalization fee.” A cold voice interrupted Philip’s conversation with his daughter.</p>  <p id = > Philip glanced at Wynn, but she only shot him an icy glare before accompanying their daughter into the ward.</p>  <p id = > Upon reaching the inpatient payment department, Philip took out his debit card.</p>  <p id = > “I’m sorry, but your card has declined,” said the nurse coldly as she swept him a look.</p>  <p id = > Oh, it’s Philip Clarke, she thought. The penniless man who keeps getting his wife to foot the medical bills. He could have asked for help from his parents-in-law, but he hasn’t. What an egoistic man, rubbish!“It’s declined?” Philip was exasperated. He grimaced and humbled himself, bowing slightly to ask, “Nurse, can you give me a few days?”</p>  <p id = > The nurse shot him a cold look with mockery in her eyes and replied, “If you don’t have any money, ask your wife! After all, you’re just a kept man.”</p>  <p id = > “You!” Philip’s expression darkened.</p>  <p id = > The nurse merely crossed her arms and scoffed. “You have until tomorrow. If you can’t pay up, then proceed with discharge.” After that, she turned around to ignore him. Saying another word to him made her feel disgusted.</p>  <p id = > How could she bully someone just because they’re poor? Philip clenched his fists tightly in a fury, feeling bitter.</p>  <p id = > The moment he turned around, he saw Wynn standing behind him radiating a cold aura, hatred was apparent in her frosty expression.</p>  <p id = > “Wynnie, don’t worry, I’ll go and gather some funds now.” Philip forced a smile.</p>  <p id = > However, both their savings were already dried up.</p>  <p id = > Tears poured down from Wynn’s eyes as her hands balled into fists. “Philip Clarke, if you’re still a man, go and beg my parents!”</p>  <p id = > “I…” Philip froze. His words were stuck in his throat.</p>  <p id = > “Hah!” Wynn scoffed as she wiped her tears. “I knew it. You never change. Is your pride more important than Mila?” She had seen through to his thoughts. Wynn then turned around with her back facing him.</p>  <p id = > Philip let out a helpless sigh and then received a notification about a delivery on his phone. He rushed to the ward, had a quick chat with his daughter before leaving.</p>  <p id = > Before he left, Wynn reminded him, “Philip Clarke, it’s my father’s birthday this weekend. If you don’t want to divorce, then go and beg my parents.”</p>  <p id = > She left him with no choice.Philip knew that this was the last shred of Wynn’s patience for him.</p>  <p id = > Just as he was about to leave the hospital, an arrogant male voice called out to him, “Wow, isn’t this Philip Clarke? Where are you rushing off to?”</p>  <p id = > Philip looked up to see a handsome man standing in front of him. The man was wearing a full suit with a fruit basket and a Peppa Pig doll in his hand.</p>  <p id = > “Juan Parker! Why are you here?” Philip’s face immediately darkened.</p>  <p id = > Juan Parker was his best buddy at university. But ever since Philip and Wynn got married, they became enemies because Juan, too, was in love with Wynn.</p>  <p id = > “I asked him to come.” Wynn suddenly appeared and walked past Philip. With an apologetic smile, she said to Juan, “Brother Juan, I’m so sorry to trouble you again.”</p>  <p id = > Upon seeing Wynn,the mocking expression on Juan’s face turned into a generous smile as he said, “It’s okay, I’m Mila’s uncle after all. This is for Mila. I’ll go and pay the bills now.” Juan then shot Philip a smug look with apparent disdain in his eyes.</p>  <p id = > The knuckles on Philip’s fists turned white. He asked Wynn coldly, “Why did you loan money from him?”</p>  <p id = > “Do you have any? Or do you want Mila to be kicked out of the hospital tomorrow?” Wynn glared icily at Philip before turning away to follow after Juan, chattering happily with him as they went.</p>  <p id = > Philip’s eyes were about to pop from their sockets out of anger at this scene. He felt his ego being dealt a heavy blow.</p>  <p id = > Money, money, money! It’s all about money with them!</p>  <p id = > Philip stood at the entrance of the hospital for the longest time before heaving a sigh.He looked up at the blue sky and then dug out his cellphone to make a call. “Howie, where are you? Let’s meet up.”</p>  <p id = > Inside a rented house, Philip and Howard Lowe sat across each other. Howard was a slightly tanned and skinny man. He handed a debit card to Philip and said, “There’s sixty thousand here. Take it for now.”</p>  <p id = > Philip’s hand was trembling as he took the card. “Howie, thank you. Thank you!”</p>  <p id = > “What’s there to thank? We’re brothers, after all.” Howard laughed.</p>  <p id = > “I object!”</p>  <p id = > There was a loud bang, and the door of the rented house was suddenly pushed open. A tall woman rushed in furiously. “Howard Lowe, that’s the bride price you were supposed to give my family. Why are you giving it to him?”</p>  <p id = > This woman was Howard’s girlfriend, Ruby Ford. Her looks were a seven out of ten, and she had a proud personality. She was a bit of a snob.“Ruru, Mila has been hospitalized, so I’m only lending this to Philip for an emergency.” Howard went over to pull at Ruby’s arm as he explained.</p>  <p id = > Ruby swung his hand away and sneered at Philip. “Hah! Philip, how many times have you borrowed money from our Howard now? If you’re going to be shameless, why should I indulge you?”</p>  <p id = > “Ruby!” Howard’s voice deepened as he tugged her sleeve.</p>  <p id = > Ruby would not back down. She pointed at Howard’s nose and blamed him. “Mr. Lowe, if you’re going to loan him the money, I’m breaking up with you! You can forget about our wedding!”</p>  <p id = > Seeing as they were about to get into a fight, Philip put the card down onto the table, stood up, and nodded apologetically. “I’m sorry. Uhm… Howie, I’ll see you guys at your wedding ceremony then. I’ll take my leave now.”</p>  <p id = > “Goodbye!” Ruby said coldly.Without waiting for Howard to chase after him, Philip had already run out of the rented house.</p>  <p id = > As soon as the door closed behind him, Ruby and Howard’s arguing voices sounded behind the door.</p>  <p id = > Philip squatted down with his phone in one hand and a cigarette in another, lost in thoughts along the streets. Being poor is a sin, and you really can’t move forward without money.</p>  <p id = > After making up his mind, Philip finally called a number he had not dialed in seven years.</p>  <p id = > The call soon got through.</p>  <p id = > “Hello, Young Master? Young Master, is that you? You’ve finally called me.” The voice on the other end sounded thrilled. There were hints of age and even sniffles.</p>  <p id = > Philip sighed helplessly and said, “George, I need money. Can you transfer me a hundred thousand?”</p>  <p id = > “Oh, Young Master, please don’t say that.I would even transfer you a billion if you wanted.” The older man on the phone was still excited, but soon, he sounded troubled. “But Young Master, according to your agreement with the master, if you want to use the finances and connections of the family, you’d have to come back and inherit the family business. Could you come over to the company, and we’ll discuss this?”</p>  <p id = > Philip pondered it for a moment before answering, “Alright, I’ll make a trip over.”</p>  <p id = > “Great! Young Master, I’ll send someone to pick you up!” Old George said enthusiastically.</p>  <p id = > “That’s okay, I can go over myself.” Philip said before asking, “Oh yes, which company?”</p>  <p id = > “Apex Group. I’ll be waiting for you at the director’s office,” said George.</p>  <p id = > After hanging up, Philip stared at the stream of people passing by in front of him.</p>  <p id = > Okay, I’ll be frank and say that I, Philip,am born with a silver spoon! My family has assets worldwide, and my family owns seventy percent of the businesses in the world.</p>  <p id = > I’ve been trying to avoid the inheritance these past seven years, so I ran away, hoping that I could experience a normal life. But today, reality has forced me to compromise.</p>  <p id = > If I don’t work hard enough, don’t have any money, I would have to go back and inherit that massive fortune.</p>  <p id = > Philip soon arrived at the Apex Group building in his scooter. It was a tall building of about three hundred meters. The company itself was ranked at number seven on the Fortune Global 500 list! But then again, all the companies in the Fortune Global 500 either belonged to the Clarke family or had a piece of share owned by them.</p>  <p id = > Upon entering the lobby, Philip was stopped by a female voice. “Hey, hey, hey, you there!Who said you could just barge in? Get out, out! Delivery men aren’t allowed inside! Call and get someone to come downstairs to meet you!” A pretty girl in black uniform blocked Philip’s path and started scolding him. She had a mature appearance and a dignified aura.</p>  <p id = > “What are you staring at? How disgusting, you rogue! Hurry up and get out!” Lily Simmons shot a hateful glare at Philip, thinking that she had seen enough delivery men in her life.thinking that she had seen enough delivery men in her life.thinking that she had seen enough delivery men in her life.</p>       <h2 id =chapter-2 > Chapter 2</h2> <p id = > Philip’s expression changed, frowning slightly.</p>  <p id = > Seeing Philip in his delivery uniform, looking shabby, Lily pointed at the door and said, “Get out now, we don’t allow delivery men here.”</p>  <p id = > “I’m not here for delivery,” explained Philip.</p>  <p id = > Lily tidied her bangs before crossing her arms and said icily, “This is not the first time I hear this. Everyone that comes in here says they’re not delivery men. Please!”</p>  <p id = > “I’m not. I’m here to see George Thomas.” Feeling exasperated, Philip headed inside after saying that.</p>  <p id = > “F*ck! Are you mad? Didn’t you hear what I was saying?” Lily was furious. It was her first time seeing such a shameless delivery man who would just force his way in after being denied entry.</p>  <p id = > Just then, a department manager seemed to have heard the commotion and came out with an ugly expression. “What’s going on?”</p>  <p id = > “Manager Stuart,this delivery man is trying to force his way into our office!” Lily pointed at Philip and then continued with much disdain, “I’ll get security to chase him out immediately!”</p>  <p id = > The manager frowned and sized Philip up before saying, “Our company doesn’t allow delivery men inside. Please leave.”</p>  <p id = > Stuart showed more courtesy, but his tone and attitude did not sound friendly. This man was a department manager of a company listed in the Fortune Global 500. To be this polite to rubbish delivery men was already very kind.</p>  <p id = > Seeing Philip still standing there in a daze, Lily was anxious to show her authority, so she pointed at him again and roared, “Did you hear that? Get out now!”</p>  <p id = > Philip was annoyed. Did she swallow a stick of dynamite, or is she on her period? This is a company owned by my family, and you’re just a watchdog!Who are you to bark at your owner? Damn it!</p>  <p id = > “I’ve already said that I’m not here for a delivery. I’m here to see George Thomas,” Philip answered coldly.</p>  <p id = > George Thomas? The manager was stunned as he stared, bewildered at Philip before snorting out a laugh. “You’re looking for our chairman?”</p>  <p id = > “George Thomas, is your chairman?” Philip was dumbstruck. Wasn’t that old man a mere secretary? Since when did he secretly become chairman? No wonder he was brave enough to want to talk about conditions. That means I can’t be soft when I see him later! I, Philip Clarke, will never inherit the family business! I’ll just take the money and go!</p>  <p id = > Stuart shook his and laughed sarcastically. “You didn’t even know that President Thomas is our chairman, and you say you’re looking for him? Do you have an appointment?”</p>  <p id = > “Mr. Stuart, stop joking.How could trash like him get an appointment?” Lily mocked as her lips curved into a sarcastic smile.</p>  <p id = > “Alright, alright. Lily, get security to come over.” Stuart waved impatiently.</p>  <p id = > “Understood, Mr. Stuart,” answered Lily in a coquettish voice before she jogged over to the front desk and picked up the phone to call the security department.</p>  <p id = > The manager was about to leave when, suddenly, an angry voice sounded at the front desk.</p>  <p id = > “George Thomas, get down here right now! I’m being held up by your receptionist. If I don’t see you in three minutes, I’m leaving.”</p>  <p id = > The other two people followed the source of the voice and saw Philip just hanging up with a lazy expression as his eyes surveyed the office environment.</p>  <p id = > The mocking smile on Lily’s lips grew, and she reproached, “You’re even putting on an act now!You deserve to be a delivery man for life!” Her hands then shifted from the phone to take a secret picture of Philip to post on her social media timeline with the caption, ‘Disgusting! Met a mad delivery man today and about to get security to kick him out…’</p>  <p id = > On one side, Stuart frowned as he shot Lily a look. The latter understood immediately and gave him an ‘OK’ gesture. She called the security department and reported, “Hello, come over to the front desk to take care of a piece of human trash.” After hanging up, Lily sat back down and started touching up her make-up, ignoring Philip.</p>  <p id = > Soon, the chairman of Apex Group, George Thomas, with his secretary in tow, came jogging out of the elevator and saw their young master waiting at the lounge from afar!</p>  <p id = > However,what made their eyes pop was seeing three security personnel about to throw the young master out!</p>  <p id = > That’s the sole heir of the family business! George instantly yelled, “Stop!”</p>  <p id = > The three security guards were just pushing Philip out when they heard the order. They turned to see their chairman rushing over with an enraged expression! Why is the chairman here?</p>  <p id = > ‘Thud!’ The three men straightened up and saluted. “Good day, Mr. President!” they greeted.</p>  <p id = > However, George did not notice them and went straight toward Philip; his face blooming like a sunflower.</p>  <p id = > The moment Lily noticed the chairman, she quickly hurried over. And when she saw Philip still standing there like an idiot, her rage grew.</p>  <p id = > “Mr. President!” Lily greeted respectfully before turning to glare at Philip with disdain. “Why are you still here? Three of you,throw him out immediately!” Lily was enraged. Were the security team blind? How could they let this trash stand in the lounge when the chairman was here? What if this madman annoyed the chairman?</p>  <p id = > George, however, shot a cold glance at Lily and reproached, “What are you doing? This is the young master of our company, the future president! Who allowed you lot to be this disrespectful?!”</p>  <p id = > Young… Young master? This guy? How was this delivery man anything like a young master?</p>  <p id = > Lily was dumbstruck. She said indignantly, “Mr. President, are you mistaken? How is he our company’s young master?”</p>  <p id = > “I’m not mistaken,” answered George coldly as the contempt for this woman grew in his heart. What kind of tone and attitude is this? Is this how you speak to your chairman?</p>  <p id = > Lily immediately realized her error and bowed in apology. “Mr. President, I’m sorry,I…”</p>  <p id = > The manager, Stuart, from before just happened to come back at that moment. He gave a flattering smile and asked, “Mr. President, why have you come down here?” As he spoke, he noticed that Philip was still here but was not aware of the current atmosphere. His face went red, and he frowned. “Why are you still here? Didn’t I tell you that our company doesn’t allow delivery men in here? Get out!”</p>  <p id = > Soon after he spoke, he felt a pair of cold eyes staring straight at him.</p>  <p id = > Oh dear, idiots were everywhere, but they were especially abundant today.</p>  <p id = > “Shut up!” George exploded furiously and roared, “He is the young master of our company! Both of you are fired!”</p>  <p id = > Philip shook his head, helplessly. “What a sin it is to be such a snob.”</p>  <p id = > “Young Master, this way please.” George bowed slightly and gestured him to go inside.This scene startled both the manager and the receptionist. Young Master? Was he really the young master?</p>  <p id = > Seeing as Philip was about to leave with the chairman, Stuart immediately rushed over to smile apologetically and begged, “Young Master, I was too blind to recognize you for who you were. Please forgive me this time.”</p>  <p id = > Stuart could see how the chairman was so respectful to the young man. Apex Group was ranked seventh in the Fortune Global 500, and the chairman himself was a prominent figure worth over billions! If a big shot like him said that this young man was the young master, then he was the young master!</p>  <p id = > Lily, too, had rushed over with a docile expression as she apologized, “Young Master, I was wrong. I won’t ever do it again.”</p>  <p id = > Philip only glanced at George indifferently.The latter instantly pointed at the security team and ordered, “What are you standing there for? Throw these two out! From today on, don’t let them take even one step into our premise!”</p>  <p id = > “Young Master, Young Master, we were wrong, please forgive us…” Stuart and Lily both ended up being tossed out of the building by security.</p>  <p id = > Upon reaching the president’s office, Philip sat down at the leather sofa while George stood respectfully at one side with his hands in front of him.</p>  <p id = > “Old George, you’re living a pretty luxurious life. This ostrich skin sofa, what great taste!” Philip patted the sofa he was sitting on and exclaimed.</p>  <p id = > George wore a humble expression as he answered, still standing, “Young Master, stop joking with this old man. If you would sign your name in this document, everything here is yours to take.” As soon as he said that,the tall secretary with delicate skin, dressed in black formal attire behind him, handed Philip a set of documents.</p>  <p id = > Philip glanced at it in disdain. “It’s not like you don’t know that I refuse to inherit my dad’s wealth. I’m here today to ask you to loan me a hundred thousand dollars.”</p>  <p id = > George smiled tactfully and said, “I refuse.”</p>  <p id = > “Say that again, old man!” Philip stood up, abruptly out of anger.</p>  <p id = > George repeated. “I refuse.”</p>  <p id = > The older man then continued with a bright smile on his wrinkled face as he tempted, “Young Master, as long as you sign this, forget a hundred thousand, even a hundred million or billions are all yours.”</p>  <p id = > “Forget it then! If I sign this document, my name isn’t Philip Clarke!” Philip raged.</p>  <p id = > Five minutes later.</p>  <p id = > “Congratulations, Young Master, you have officially inherited all Clarke family’s wealth and businesses.Here is your hundred thousand.”</p>  <p id = > How delightful!</p>  <p id = > George stared at the signed document with his face blooming like a chrysanthemum flower.</p>  <p id = > At the same time, the secretary beside him brought over a briefcase and opened it. It was a hundred thousand in cash!</p>  <p id = > “George, old man, you’re too lavish. This briefcase looks like it’s carrying a hundred million instead,” said Philip as he picked up a plastic bag lying beside and put the money in. “I’ll be taking my leave now.”</p>  <p id = > “Take care, Young Master. Do you need me to get a car ready for you?” George asked respectfully.</p>  <p id = > “That’s okay, I came on my scooter,” answered Philip, and he walked out of the office with the plastic bag in hand.</p>  <p id = > After Philip had left, George immediately brought the documents up to the conference room on the top floor and started a video conference.</p>  <p id = > “Master,the young master has finally signed.” Old George stood in front of the large screen, bowing slightly as he reported with much enthusiasm and respect.</p>  <p id = > The screen showed an old man in a wheelchair. The old man coughed for a bit before slowly lifting a hand and said in a weak voice, “Then… pass on the message…”</p>  <p id = > “Yes, Master,” answered George, wiping his tears as he looked at the old man on the screen.</p>  <p id = > In an instant, the top management of all the businesses under the Clarke family received an email informing them that the sole heir of the Clarke family, Philip Clarke, had officially inherited the family business! These businesses include properties, development, entertainment, production, finance, investment, information technology,and etcetera…</p>  <p id = > Philip returned to the hospital and rushed over to the ward just in time to see Wynn and Juan leaning close to each other as they chattered happily.</p>  <p id = > Philip frowned as he balled his hands into fists.</p>  <p id = > “Philip Clarke, where have you been?” Upon seeing him, Wynn asked coldly. To think this man still had the heart to run around, ignoring his daughter. Wynn’s gaze held disappointment as she looked at Philip.</p>  <p id = > Juan, who was sitting beside him, snorted in laughter. “Philip, were you away trying to borrow money? It’s okay; I can foot the medical bills. I’m Mila’s uncle, after all.”</p>  <p id = > “I don’t need you to worry about my daughter’s medical expenses; I can pay up.” Philip walked in with an icy expression.</p>  <p id = > “Philip Clarke, how can you behave this way toward Brother Juan! Apologize to him!” Wynn started scolding him,thinking that she knew her husband well enough to know that he was disrespectful on purpose. Brother Juan was kind enough to help them foot the bill, but this man was sour to him. How rude!</p>  <p id = > Juan feigned kindness and urged Wynn, saying, “Wynnie, don’t get angry. Philip must be feeling upset because he didn’t manage to borrow any money.”</p>  <p id = > Wynn shot Philip a furious glare as she looked down on him even more.</p>  <p id = > Philip tried to hold his rage back as he stared at both of them with clenched fists. He wanted so much to throw a punch at Juan’s face. Wynnie? He’s calling her by her pet name so affectionately! Jesus, Wynn Johnston, I’m your husband here. Have you no shame?Juan feigned kindness and urged Wynn, saying, “Wynnie, don’t get angry. Philip must be feeling upset because he didn’t manage to borrow any money.”</p>  <p id = > Wynn shot Philip a furious glare as she looked down on him even more.</p>  <p id = > Philip tried to hold his rage back as he stared at both of them with clenched fists. He wanted so much to throw a punch at Juan’s face. Wynnie? He’s calling her by her pet name so affectionately! Jesus, Wynn Johnston, I’m your husband here. Have you no shame?Juan feigned kindness and urged Wynn, saying, “Wynnie, don’t get angry.

He’s calling her by her pet name so affectionately! Jesus, Wynn Johnston, I’m your husband here. Have you no shame?Wynnie? He’s calling her by her pet name so affectionately! Jesus, Wynn Johnston, I’m your husband here. Have you no shame?</p>           <h2 id =chapter-3 > Chapter 3</h2> <p id = > “It’s just money. Who said I didn’t manage to borrow any?” Philip glared viciously at Juan.</p>  <p id = > Juan was dumbstruck as his expression froze. When the surprise was still evident in his eyes, Philip tossed the plastic bag in his hand in front of him and Wynn.</p>  <p id = > The bag fell with a loud thud and rolls of cash appeared before their eyes.</p>  <p id = > The corner of Juan’s eye twitched slightly as his lips trembled. His hands had subconsciously balled into fists.</p>  <p id = > Wynn was surprised. She stared at the money Philip had tossed in front of them, confused, but then her expression immediately turned cold as anger surfaced in her eyes.</p>  <p id = > Where did Philip get all this money? If he had this, why didn’t he take it out earlier? I even had to keep another man company by chatting happily with him! Doesn’t he know how tiring it is?</p>  <p id = > “Here’s a hundred thousand.I’m paying you back all at once, including the past loans! Don’t ever come here again,” said Philip coldly.</p>  <p id = > Juan did not take the money. To be frank, this hundred thousand did not amount to much in his eyes. He only thought of it as a charity to the poor.</p>  <p id = > “Well done, Philip. You manage to fund this much in such a short time. But I’m curious, who would lend you so much in such a short amount of time?” Juan asked ambiguously, feeling his ego being shaken. He had stayed there just to wait for Philip to come back so he could ridicule him. Besides, he wanted to show Wynn just how terrible the man she had chosen was!</p>  <p id = > But now, the words that Juan wanted to say were all stuck in his throat. This feeling of discomfort and a lump in his throat made him antsy.</p>  <p id = > “Does it have anything to do with you?” answered Philip indifferently.Wynn could no longer stand it. She stood up and yelled at him, “That’s enough, Philip! Brother Juan has helped us out so many times now, so how can you say that?”</p>  <p id = > “Did I ask him for help? Don’t you have any idea who he’s doing all this for?” Philip retorted, his rage barely visible in his eyes.</p>  <p id = > Wynn was stunned. Of course, she knew why Juan cared for Mila so much. However, being exposed so directly by her husband hurt her pride. She accused, “What do you mean by this?”</p>  <p id = > Philip took a deep breath to calm his emotions. He had been arguing with Wynn a lot more recently. “Aren’t you leaving?” He moved the conversation back to Juan.</p>  <p id = > Juan snickered. He then picked up the money and left without saying more.</p>  <p id = > Wynn shot a furious glare at Philip before chasing after Juan. “Brother Juan, let me see you out!”</p>  <p id = > It was finally quiet.Philip sat down beside Mila’s bed and watched his daughter sleeping soundly. He felt immense guilt.</p>  <p id = > “Mila, is it hard for you to be with Papa? But I’ll tell you what, from today onwards, you’ll be a little princess.” Philip stroked his daughter’s forehead gently with great affection in his eyes.</p>  <p id = > Just then, Wynn returned to the room. She asked coldly, “Where did you get the money from?”</p>  <p id = > Philip answered without ever looking up. “I borrowed it.”</p>  <p id = > “From who?”</p>  <p id = > “Howie.”</p>  <p id = > Wynn breathed a sigh of relief. She had thought that he borrowed it from a loan shark. “You’ve already borrowed from him too many times. You can’t keep troubling him. Make sure to return it to him soon. I heard he’s getting married.”</p>  <p id = > “I know. I’ll return it to him as soon as I can.” Philip finally looked at Wynn.</p>  <p id = > This woman was really beautiful.Even with her brows pinched together, there was still a charm to her. It was just a pity she did not know that her good-for-nothing husband, who had collapsed after one setback, was now the heir to the world’s wealthiest family. He could now summon clouds and rain with just a nod of his head.</p>  <p id = > Wynn’s gaze gradually fell darker. She looked at her daughter lying on the sickbed and said, “Philip, you managed to borrow money this time, but what about the next? Will you have to borrow money every time Mila gets hospitalized?”</p>  <p id = > The old Philip had been vigorous and spirited back then. It was also the reason why she fell for him. But after he had failed in his startup, Philip could not pick himself up again, and he became more and more wretched.</p>  <p id = > Philip was slightly irritated. “I know what to do.”</p>  <p id = > Wynn kept quiet for a moment before continuing to say, “Philip, even if it’s not for yourself, think of it as doing something for Mila. Come with me to my father’s birthday this weekend. Apologize to my parents.”</p>  <p id = > Philip kept quiet, only clenching his fists. Seeing him unwilling to say anything, Wynn grew more annoyed. She stomped her foot, took her bag, and scolded him, “Then, just keep being this wretched for the rest of your life!”</p>  <p id = > After watching Wynn stomp out of the room in anger, Philip finally let out a helpless sigh. Life without money and prestige sucked. Would his father-in-law ever approve of him?</p>  <p id = > In the afternoon, Philip had some urgent matters to take care of, so he got the nurse to look after Mila. Wynn was busy with work, so she was already back at her office.</p>  <p id = > Philip got onto his scooter,refreshed his delivery list to start working again. He received a delivery task at Intercontinental Hotel. The people who could afford a room here were mostly rich.</p>  <p id = > Upon reaching suite room number 8808, Philip knocked on the door. “Hello, your delivery is here.”</p>  <p id = > Following a click, the door was opened, and a fit woman came into view. She was wearing a crop top with spaghetti straps and black shorts. There was a tattoo of a rose on her thigh, and her hair was disheveled, her make up exquisite.</p>  <p id = > “Hello, your…” Philip handed her the delivery with a bright smile before stopping halfway. “Ruby… Ruby Ford?”</p>  <p id = > “Philip?”</p>  <p id = > The girl standing in front of him was Howard’s girlfriend, Ruby Ford. She was staring at Philip with a surprised expression as suspicion and anger flashed in her eyes.</p>  <p id = > “Ruru, are you done? I can’t wait any longer!You have even brought bunny ears today, hehe…” Coming from within the room was the revolting voice of a middle-aged man.</p>  <p id = > Ruby shot Philip a glare, snatched the delivery from him, and slammed the door shut.</p>  <p id = > Philip stood dumbfounded outside the door for a long time before he regained his senses.</p>  <p id = > Shit! Why is Ruby here? She’s even in a room with another man! Should I tell Howie?</p>  <p id = > Half an hour later, Philip met Ruby at the lounge downstairs. The latter had put on a black trench coat and trotted over in her high heels before sitting on the opposite of Philip. She took out three hundred dollars from her purse and placed it on the coffee table, saying coldly, “This is for you.”</p>  <p id = > Philip stared at the three hundred and snorted. “Is this a bribe?”</p>  <p id = > Ruby frowned and dug out another two hundred to toss onto the table. “Five hundred!Is that enough? This is worth two days of your salary.”</p>  <p id = > Well, that escalated quickly!</p>  <p id = > Philip stood up, looking furious and said through gritted teeth, “Ruby, how could you do this to Howie! He has worked so hard for you, and you two were going to get married by the end of the year!”</p>  <p id = > “So what? Who says I will marry him?” Ruby snorted and lit a ladies’ cigarette, saying nonchalantly, “Philip, why don’t you just mind your own business. You keep coming to borrow money from Howie, and that’s starting to irritate me.</p>  <p id = > “You’re a man, don’t you have any sense of shame? It’s no wonder your wife wants to divorce you, trash!” Ruby then stood up and crossed her arms, staring proudly at Philip. “Don’t say a word about what happened today, or I’ll get someone to break your leg.” After that,Ruby went over to the plump middle-aged man who was waiting aside, and both of them left the hotel, arm in arm.</p>  <p id = > Philip clenched his fists tightly. After he took the money on the table, he left the hotel and made a mental note to tell Howie about it.</p>  <p id = > Just then, Philip’s phone rang. A glance at the caller ID showed that it was a call from his manager, Wilson Young.</p>  <p id = > The moment he answered the call, a thundering rage exploded from the other end. “Philip, what the f*ck are you doing?! I’ve received more than ten complaint phone calls! Were you delivering to Mars? Come straight back after your delivery, then pack up and get lost!”</p>  <p id = > Wilson was going insane with anger. In just half an hour, he had received more than ten complaint phone calls about Philip. It was driving him crazy! Was this trash trying to work at all?</p>  <p id = > “Mr. Young,you can stop scolding me because I f*cking quit! I just fired you!”</p>  <p id = > “Say what? Philip Clar-…”</p>  <p id = > Philip hung up.</p>  <p id = > To begin with, he was already mad, and now a mere manager was scolding him to boot. Life had forced him to tolerate it all back then, but things were different now. He had been made to inherit his family fortune and was now the heir of the world’s biggest consortium, so how could he let just anybody berate him so simply?</p>  <p id = > Philip dug out his phone and called George. “George, I want to repurchase my company, can I?”</p>  <p id = > George answered, “Young Master, that company was originally founded by you, but you ended up selling it due to bankruptcy. If you want to repurchase it, just say the word.”</p>  <p id = > Philip said calmly, “Okay. In ten minutes, I want to become its owner!”</p>  <p id = > Two minutes later, George sent Philip a short message: Young Master.It’s done. You are now the owner of Gopher Delivery Services.</p>  <p id = > Philip nodded. George was very efficient.</p>  <p id = > Philip got onto his scooter and went straight to the office. Wilson Young, wait for daddy! Just wait and see how I’ll skin you alive!</p>  <p id = > Gopher Delivery Services was the company Philip had founded. However, due to poor management, he went into bankruptcy and had to sell it off. Overnight, Philip had turned from a boss to a lowly staff. He lost all his glamour and was left with only endless mockery and cold reception.</p>  <p id = > At Gopher Deliver Services Limited Liability Company, Wilson Young stared at his phone in the lounge, throwing a fit of rage.</p>  <p id = > “Shit! This Philip is just looking for trouble! Just because I can’t fire you, who are you to speak that way to me?”</p>  <p id = > The several staff members standing aside were all shrinking their necks,afraid of getting caught in the fire.</p>  <p id = > Just then, the main door of the company was pushed open, and a middle-aged man walked in. Upon seeing the man, Wilson instantly put on a flattering smile. “Boss, why didn’t you tell us you were coming? I could have gone to welcome you.”</p>  <p id = > It was the company’s owner, Kevin Tank.</p>  <p id = > Mr. Tank glanced at him before saying, “Everyone, prepare yourselves to welcome the new owner.”</p>  <p id = > Wilson was stunned. “The new owner?”</p>  <p id = > Mr. Tank said, “Someone has spent ten million to buy this company.”</p>  <p id = > Wilson asked cautiously, “Who is this new owner? Should we prepare something?”</p>  <p id = > Mr. Tank frowned and answered, “I’m not familiar with the new owner, so everyone, be on your toes later.”</p>  <p id = > After that, the staff followed Mr. Tank to standby at the main entrance of the company.Wilson was instead showing off his authority by saying, “Everyone, keep your spirits up! The new owner will be here soon. If you perform nicely, you might even get a raise or a promotion! This is about you and your wallets!”</p>  <p id = > “What a scoundrel, only knowing how to kiss up!”</p>  <p id = > “He must mean ‘this is about him.’ What bootlicker!”</p>  <p id = > A few staff were gossiping quietly. This was not the first time they felt contempt for Wilson Young. The man was just like them before, a mere delivery staff. But he was such a shameless bootlicker that he had ended up securing a manager position only by sucking up to the higher management.</p>  <p id = > Just then, a black Bentley stopped steadily in front of the company’s entrance. After some thought, George had decided to come and take a look at the company in person, thinking that he could be of help to the young master.If it could put the young master in a good mood, the young man might even make a trip home.</p>  <p id = > Wilson was standing behind Mr. Tank, rubbing his hands in anticipation. “He’s here! He’s here.” He knew that the arrival of the new owner meant the arrival of his opportunity to show his performance!</p>  <p id = > Just then, Philip, too, arrived and stopped his scooter right in front of the Bentley.</p>  <p id = > The moment he saw Philip, Wilson’s whole body trembled with rage. He pointed at Philip and yelled, “Philip Clarke, why are you here? Hurry up and get out of the way!”too, arrived and stopped his scooter right in front of the Bentley.</p>  <p id = > The moment he saw Philip, Wilson’s whole body trembled with rage. He pointed at Philip and yelled, “Philip Clarke, why are you here? Hurry up and get out of the way!”too, arrived and stopped his scooter right in front of the Bentley.</p>  <p id = > The moment he saw Philip, Wilson’s whole body trembled with rage. He pointed at Philip and yelled, “Philip Clarke, why are you here? Hurry up and get out of the way!”</p>                                      <h2 id =chapter-4 > Chapter 4</h2> <p id = > Wilson was now boiling with anger! That madman blocked the new boss’ Bentley! Was he looking for trouble?</p>  <p id = > “Philip Clarke, what are you still standing there for? Get out of the way!” Wilson pointed at Philip and barked at him.</p>  <p id = > Philip had only just parked his scooter when he received another round of scolding from Wilson.</p>  <p id = > “Oh no! Philip’s done for this time. Brother Wil’s going to have a fit.”</p>  <p id = > “Ten complaint calls, and this crazy guy still has the guts to come back!”</p>  <p id = > “This will cost at least two hundred in deductions, that’s a day’s work!”</p>  <p id = > A few staff were gossiping quietly, and some others were enjoying the show. Among them were some old staff who used to work for Philip. When they saw the man reduced to the point of having to become a delivery man just like them, they started becoming more mean toward him. Philip was already used to it.Just then, Mr. Tanks glanced at Philip coldly. He looked annoyed and asked, “Manager Young, is this your staff?”</p>  <p id = > Wilson quickly answered heavy sarcasm in his tone, “Boss, you don’t come here often, so I forgot to introduce you. This is Philip Clarke, our company’s ex-owner. He’s now just a lowly delivery man here.”</p>  <p id = > Wilson deliberately emphasized the word ‘ex-owner’ as he said it with thick mockery. Oh, Philip, you’ll be getting what you deserve thanks to karma, hahaha!</p>  <p id = > Mr. Tanks’ expression darkened. He frowned and said, “Clear out that good-for-nothing so we can welcome the new owner.” He finally remembered Philip, the sad young man who had sold him this company years ago. Unfortunately, Mr. Tanks had great wits but a short memory, so a man like Philip who was on the lower level in society never left too much of an impression.</p>  <p id = > Mr.Tanks then straightened up his suit and moved toward the Bentley with a massive smile.</p>  <p id = > Upon receiving the order, Wilson immediately assumed authority and pointed cheekily at Philip. “Philip, pack your bags and go!”</p>  <p id = > Philip rolled his eyes and stared at Wilson like an idiot before spitting a single word, “Lunatic.”</p>  <p id = > Everyone present had heard his response, and their expression turned odd.</p>  <p id = > Wilson immediately flared up. His finger was so close to poking Philip’s nose as he bellowed, “F*ck! Try saying that again!”</p>  <p id = > Philip then let out a cold laugh. “As you wish then, you lunatic! Your whole family is crazy!”</p>  <p id = > “You’re a dead man, Philip! You are now fired, and you need to reimburse the company for the losses you have made!” Wilson said through gritted teeth as he glared at Philip with widened eyes.</p>  <p id = > This man doesn’t know his place!He should be reminded that he’s no longer the boss of Gopher Delivery Services, but he’s so arrogant! Just wait and see how I’ll deal with you later!</p>  <p id = > Suddenly, the Bentley’s door opened, and an elderly man with a walking stick came out with a furious expression. “Who dares to fire him?!” The elderly man then walked past Kevin Tanks, who had come to receive him with a smile on his face, and to everyone’s surprise, stopped in front of Philip.</p>  <p id = > He straightened up, bent over slightly, and lowered his head. His actions were fluid, showing great respect. “Young Master, sorry I was late,” said the old man. His voice was not loud, but it sounded like a pin dropping in the silence.</p>  <p id = > Young Master? Everyone was stunned! Had Philip Clarke suddenly become a young master? What was going on?</p>  <p id = > Kevin Tanks was dumbstruck as the smile on his face stiffened.Wilson instead was so shocked that he let out a huge laugh. “Old Mister, are you our new owner? You can stop joking around. This Philip is the lowest level of staff in our company, so you must be mistaken!”</p>  <p id = > George merely glanced at him coldly, thinking, how could an ordinary fellow like him understand his young master’s greatness?</p>  <p id = > Kevin frowned slightly and jogged over before ardently saying, “President Thomas, please don’t joke with us like that. Come, let’s talk inside.”</p>  <p id = > Kevin Tanks was an entrepreneur, so he could recognize George Thomas. The man was the president of Apex Group! An overpowering figure in Riverdale City!</p>  <p id = > However, George remained rooted to the spot, glaring coldly at Kevin and Wilson with a dark expression. “Who’s joking with you? This is your company’s new owner!”</p>  <p id = > How was that possible? The new owner was Philip? Wilson did not believe it, and neither could Kevin.</p>  <p id = > “Brother Will, didn’t you just say that you want to fire me?” Philip looked at Wilson, trying not to smile.</p>  <p id = > “Philip! Are you asking for trouble? Don’t call me ‘Brother Will’!” Wilson roared. He hated that nickname.</p>  <p id = > “You better scram now and reimburse the company’s loss! That’ll be ten thousand!” Wilson smiled sardonically. Hah! How could Philip be the new owner of the company? With the likes of him? Don’t make me laugh.</p>  <p id = > Philip, however, was still staring at Wilson, trying not to laugh.</p>  <p id = > “What are you staring at? Hand out the money now!” Wilson sneered.</p>  <p id = > “What’s wrong with me staring?” Philip smiled.</p>  <p id = > “You’re just looking for trouble, aren’t you? I’d just be doing you a favor if I didn’t fire you for what you have just said.” Wilson stood his ground, snickering. He was the company’s manager, so he naturally had the authority to fire a staff below him.</p>  <p id = > “Then, I’ll tell you what, Wilson. I’m firing you now, so you can beat it.” Philip leaned against his scooter with his hands stuffed in this pocket as he said nonchalantly.</p>  <p id = > This Wilson Young was an idiot. He still could not figure things out at this point, but Kevin Tanks, who had been standing on the side, had finally come to a realization!</p>  <p id = > Shit! Philip is the company’s new owner! At this thought, cold sweat started to form on Kevin’s forehead as he looked away, reluctant to face this scene. He wanted to strangle Wilson.</p>  <p id = > “What did you say? You fire me?” Wilson laughed with a twisted expression. Did this Philip hit his head somewhere to be able to spout such nonsense?</p>  <p id = > At that moment, George,who had been standing beside Philip, shot Wilson a cold glance. “If our young master says to fire you, you’re fired!” George’s expression was dark. To think that someone would have the audacity to humiliate their young master, what a fool!</p>  <p id = > Wilson then realized that his new boss was standing right in front of him. But before he could react, Kevin had thrown a tight slap across his face and roared, “Wilson Young, get lost this instant! You’re fired!”</p>  <p id = > This Wilson Young was an idiot! Kevin wondered how he had believed this man and had even promoted him to a manager position in the first place.</p>  <p id = > “Boss, what do you mean by this?” Wilson held a hand to his cheek, staring at Kevin in disbelief.</p>  <p id = > “What I mean is that Philip Clarke is the new owner, and since he says you’re fired, you’re fired!”</p>  <p id = > Everyone was stunned at Kevin’s words!Wilson’s whole body was trembling as he shouted, “Impossible! He’s already bankrupt, so how could a broke man like him be the new owner?”</p>  <p id = > Kevin frowned. “He’s not as simple as you think he is!”</p>  <p id = > Wilson turned to look at Philip, his expression faltering. He finally realized that the old man standing in front of Philip was President Thomas of Apex Group! A rich man worth billions and the wealthiest man of Riverdale City! And if he addressed Philip as his young master, then…</p>  <p id = > “Wilson Young, from now onwards, you’re fired. Beat it!” Philip straightened himself up. After he spoke, Wilson stood rooted to his spot, dumbstruck.</p>  <p id = > Weren’t you just enjoying yourself scolding me earlier? You were even trying to fire me. But, too bad for you, I’m the new owner here. If I want you gone, you’re gone!</p>  <p id = > There was a loud thud.Wilson fell to his knees and clung onto Philip’s leg. “Mr. Clarke, I was too blind to recognize you for who you were. I was too full of myself. Please don’t fire me. Seeing that we used to be colleagues, please let me stay in the company. I’m willing even to make deliveries!”</p>  <p id = > Philip snorted. “Now you know that you’re at fault. But, would you have forgiven me if this didn’t happen? Your wrongdoings will only bring about self-destruction!” Philip had pushed Wilson over a cliff with just a few words. After that, he turned to look at the company’s staff and said, “I know that a lot of you had looked down on me when I was in my darkest moments, but that’s okay. From today on, all of your salaries will be doubled!”</p>  <p id = > In an instant, the staff all went into an uproar! Double pay!</p>  <p id = > “Mr. Clarke is awesome!”</p>  <p id = > “I love you, Mr. Clarke!”</p>  <p id = > Philip then looked at a beautiful woman standing at the back of the crowd and announced, “One more thing, Wilson’s manager position will be replaced by Miss Agnes Summer.”</p>  <p id = > ‘Swish!’</p>  <p id = > The crowd turned their heads back to look at Agnes, a woman dressed in a black uniform skirt set that accentuated her perfect figure.</p>  <p id = > Agnes stared at Philip in surprise, unable to catch her breath until Philip was about to leave. Seeing as he was about to disappear into the Bentley, a peculiar emotion sparked in her eyes. Agnes ran to the car and stopped right in front of the car window, her chest almost falling out. She pursed her lips then said, “Philip… No, Mr. Clarke, are you promoting me to become a manager?”</p>  <p id = > Philip’s eyes indistinctly stole a glance at Agnes’ fair bosom, then he smiled and asked, “Sister Agnes,what’s wrong? Don’t you believe in your abilities?”</p>  <p id = > This woman, Agnes Summer, was sensible, had a great figure, and was beautiful. She had been working under Philip before this, so promoting her now was not unexpected. This was the privilege of being the boss.</p>  <p id = > “I… I’m just afraid I might not be good enough.” Agnes sounded conflicted. She had never imagined that Philip would become the new owner so suddenly. Although he was already the owner before this, the company was tiny, with only a few staff. The company’s turnover had now exceeded five million every year! That must mean that Philip had spent billions on buying over the company today!</p>  <p id = > “Relax, Sister Agnes, take your time to get used to things, and don’t worry.” Philip smiled, and that served as a tranquilizer for Agnes.</p>  <p id = > As she watched Philip leave in the Bentley,Agnes pursed her red lips as she pondered. Just who exactly is he? Why did he have to act poor if he was so rich in the first place?</p>  <p id = > Inside the Bentley.</p>  <p id = > “Young Master, there is an investment project tomorrow, and you have to meet the other company’s boss.” A smile appeared on George’s wrinkled face.</p>  <p id = > “I’m not going,” answered Philip crisply. He did not want to care about any of this. I was forced to inherit the family wealth, so don’t even think about asking me to go anywhere!</p>  <p id = > “Then, Young Master, please return that hundred thousand to me,” said George calmly.</p>  <p id = > Philip’s eyes widened in shock before finally answering, albeit reluctantly, “Fine, fine, fine! I’ll go, okay?”</p>  <p id = > To think that the heir of a wealthy family like me has to bend over backward for a hundred thousand! How sad! Sigh!</p>  <p id = > “Alright, Young Master.I will come and pick you up tomorrow.” George smiled.</p>  <p id = > As soon as he got out of the car, Philip heard a puzzled voice. “Philip? Why are you here?”</p>  <p id = > Philip subconsciously turned to see Wynn with a confused expression as she stared at him with an odd gaze.</p>  <p id = > Philip panicked internally. Oh no! Wynn is going to find out about my identity!</p>    <h2 id =chapter-5 > Chapter 5</h2> <p id = > “Why are you here?” Wynn frowned and glanced at the Bentley beside Philip. Did he just come out from that car? Is this my wretched husband? Or do delivery companies now deliver meals in Bentleys?</p>  <p id = > “I… I uh…” Philip stammered then swept a look at George who was smiling like a flower through the window.</p>  <p id = > The old man quickly put out a hand and said, “Young man, thank you. It’s thanks to you that I finally found this place. Let this old man treat you to a meal next time to show my gratitude.”</p>  <p id = > Philip smiled and nodded politely. “That’s okay, sir. Please take care on your way back.” The tone of his voice hinted to the elderly man to leave quickly.</p>  <p id = > George did not say anything but smiled and nodded at Wynn before asking the driver to move away.</p>  <p id = > Wynn froze in shock! Wasn’t… wasn’t that the chairman of Apex Group, President Thomas?!The wealthiest man in the city! And Philip was just in the same car with him!</p>  <p id = > “Do you know George Thomas?” Wynn looked back at Philip, surprised.</p>  <p id = > Philip shrugged. “No, I don’t. That old thing was lost, so I just led the way.”</p>  <p id = > That old thing? The corner of Wynn’s mouth twitched. He had called the wealthiest man in the city ‘that old thing’? How rude!</p>  <p id = > “What do you mean by ‘old thing.’ That man is the wealthiest in Riverdale, the president of Apex Group!” Wynn rolled her eyes at Philip. This man was senseless. The more Wynn looked at him, the more contempt she felt. She merely said coldly, “Philip, don’t forget that my father will be hosting a get-together this weekend at Virtuous Court. Prepare some gifts.”</p>  <p id = > “I never said I would go,” answered Philip.</p>  <p id = > “You!” Wynn was irked. She had put in a lot of effort to persuade her father,telling him that Philip would come and apologize to him, and she hoped that her father would not give him such a hard time. But, what was with Philip’s attitude? Forget it, forget him. She must have been blind back then to fall for this man.</p>  <p id = > “Do as you please then!” Wynn’s temper flared up, and with a twist of her slender waist, she turned to leave.</p>  <p id = > As Philip watched her leave, he noticed that she had changed clothes. She even seemed to be wearing perfume and had makeup on. Philip was puzzled as he saw her enter a large building. He started pondering, Didn’t Wynn say she was going back to the office? Why was she here? And where was this? It’s Hilton Hotel!</p>  <p id = > At the thought of that, Philip felt anger rise in him. He was putting in so much effort at work, but she came to a hotel? This would not do. He must follow her and see what was going on!Wynn was very stressed out today. First, her daughter’s heart disease had relapsed under the care of that irresponsible Philip. Next, she had to worry about that whole matter with Juan Parker, and after she returned to the office, one of her projects was facing some challenging patch.</p>  <p id = > The president of this project stood her up and insisted that she come for a discussion at the Hilton. Wynn had wanted to refuse, but the client was using the project to pressure her, so she had to show up. This project was worth a million!</p>  <p id = > Just then, her phone rang. “Hello, President Warren, I’ve arrived. Where are you?”</p>  <p id = > “I’m waiting for you at the restaurant on the sixth floor.” The mellow voice of a man sounded from the other end of the call.</p>  <p id = > “Alright, President Warren, I’ll be over soon.” Wynn smiled.</p>  <p id = > After she hung up, Wynn let out a sigh,looking a little hesitant as she stared at the elevator before finally deciding to go upstairs after all.</p>  <p id = > The moment the elevator doors closed, Philip appeared in the lobby and saw that Wynn had gone up from afar. He ran after her, but a cold, mocking voice stopped him instead.</p>  <p id = > “Wow, isn’t this my cousin brother-in-law who works as a delivery man? Are you delivering to the Hilton?”</p>  <p id = > Philip turned his head to see a gorgeous and fashionable couple, leaning close to each other. The girl had her arms crossed with a mocking expression as she leaned into the arms of a tall and handsome man.</p>  <p id = > “Lynn Johnston?” Philip frowned before taking note that the elevator had stopped on the sixth floor.</p>  <p id = > The girl walked over with a taunting look and laughed. “What a coincidence to see you here. It looks like your area of coverage is extensive.”</p>  <p id = > This girl was Lynn Johnston, Wynn’s younger cousin sister. She was only a freshman in college, but she looked like a fine woman.</p>  <p id = > “Lynnie, who’s this?” The handsome man beside Lynn signaled her with his eye and asked.</p>  <p id = > Lynn immediately snorted. “He’s my cousin brother-in-law. Didn’t I tell you before? The one whose business failed and had to do deliveries for a living. He even borrowed a few thousand bucks from me but hasn’t returned it yet.”</p>  <p id = > Lynn had always looked down on Philip because he was just rubbish! She always felt that a frog like him did not match up to her cousin. While the man did marry her cousin sister, it was more accurate to say he married into her family instead. How shameful.</p>  <p id = > “Haha, this is the cousin brother-in-law you’ve been talking about?” The man laughed out loud, the mockery visible in his eyes.Philip was starting to get annoyed. He was Lynn’s cousin brother-in-law after all, so what was she trying to achieve by getting outsiders to humiliate him too?</p>  <p id = > “I’ll return you the money, but I have something to do now. So, I won’t keep both of you company.” Philip forced out a smile.</p>  <p id = > Lynn was still Wynn’s cousin sister, so as an elder, Philip felt that he should exercise more tolerance. If she knew that he was now the heir to the world’s largest consortium, he wondered what expression Lynn would have right now and how would she react?</p>  <p id = > Humans are always superficial and ignorant.</p>  <p id = > “Return me the money? I’m not counting on it. With your pay as a delivery man, would it even be enough to cure Mila?” Lynn asked sarcastically. Her cousin brother-in-law was trash! And that little b*tch should have never been born!Lynn did not think much of Philip, so naturally, she felt the same for his daughter.</p>  <p id = > When Philip heard this, his expression gradually turned cold.</p>  <p id = > “Lynn Johnston, I am still your cousin brother-in-law. Don’t you think you’re too rude?”</p>  <p id = > “Hah!” Lynn snorted. “I’ve never acknowledged you as my cousin brother-in-law. You just happened to be clinging onto my cousin sister and married into our family, nothing more.” How shameless! Who did he think he was to use his identity to pressure her?</p>  <p id = > “Wow, he’s a live-in son-in-law?” Lynn’s boyfriend laughed, sounding surprised. How wretched was this man to be able to stoop so low?</p>  <p id = > Lynn waved her hand before tugging her boyfriend’s arm and said, “Forget it, let’s go, Hugh. Standing beside a person like this makes the air all greasy and smelly.”</p>  <p id = > Philip’s eyes darkened.His hands balled into fists as he watched Lynn swaying her hips and walking away with her boyfriend in tow. The two people were still mumbling to each other.</p>  <p id = > “Your cousin brother-in-law is worthless.”</p>  <p id = > “He’s not my cousin brother-in-law. If you keep saying that, I’ll stop talking to you.”</p>  <p id = > Philip took a deep breath to calm his emotions. He should not be bothering himself with brats like them. He then turned around and ran into the elevator to go up to the sixth floor.</p>  <p id = > Philip had circled the whole area before finally noticing Wynn’s silhouette inside a Western restaurant through a glass wall.</p>  <p id = > What the f*ck!</p>  <p id = > What angered him was the sight of a bald and oily fat man sitting across Wynn, reaching out his arm as he tried to touch Wynn’s hand with a disgusting expression on his face.</p>  <p id = > Oh, a cuckoo bird! Wait,where is it going? This is not a beautiful sight at all!</p>  <p id = > Philip was furious! He dug out his phone and called Wynn immediately.</p>  <p id = > Inside the restaurant, Wynn tactfully rejected Manager Warren’s goodwill countless times, but the man was unwilling to give up. He was even trying to touch her hand!</p>  <p id = > It was at this moment, her phone suddenly rang. This was her chance to take a breather.</p>  <p id = > “I’m sorry, Manager Warren, let me take this call,” said Wynn, and she stood up to walk out of the restaurant.</p>  <p id = > Manager Warren’s tiny eyes narrowed as he stared at Wynn’s back profile. He could not stop himself. He was thinking to himself that he will surely punish this proud woman tonight!</p>  <p id = > “Hello, Philip, is something up?” Wynn stood outside the restaurant.</p>  <p id = > “I’m in front of you.”</p>  <p id = > Wynn then abruptly looked up to see Philip staring coldly at her.She frowned in confusion. Why was he here?</p>  <p id = > “Are you following me?” Wynn walked over with a frosty expression and asked icily. She had just run into Philip downstairs, and now he was here at the restaurant entrance. What was this if it was not stalking? Excellent job Philip, you’re even starting this disgusting hobby of stalking someone now?</p>  <p id = > Philip laughed. “I don’t have that kind of time to be following you. I just happened to pass by.” He then glanced over at the fatty inside the restaurant and asked, “Who’s he? Is he more important than Mila?” To come out and meet this fat man instead of going to the hospital. You’re something, aren’t you?</p>  <p id = > Wynn was annoyed by Philip’s interrogative tone, but she explained nonetheless, “A business partner. We’re here for a business discussion.”</p>  <p id = > “A business discussion? I saw him making moves on you.Are you having a business discussion or a date?” Philip questioned.</p>  <p id = > Wynn’s expression darkened. She crossed her arms and said in a hateful tone, “Philip Clarke, what are you trying to say? Are you suspecting me of an affair? I grind myself away every day, working just to earn money to cure Mila! But, what about you? Does making deliveries every day earn you a great future? I have asked you to apologize to my parents, but have you done that? You’re just a coward!”</p>  <p id = > As she spoke, Wynn grew more agitated as tears started to pool in her eyes. She turned away and sniffled. “Forget it. It’s no use telling you anything. I’m not coming back tonight.”</p>  <p id = > Was she not coming back? Philip was dumbstruck. Did she mean she was going to stay out tonight? With this fatso?</p>  <p id = > “What if I can help you?” asked Philip. Seeing Wynn in this state,Philip could easily guess that this discussion was not easy. That business partner must be threatening her. At the same time, he felt guilty, realizing that his attitude had been inappropriate earlier.</p>  <p id = > “What can you help me with? Can you bring me a one million dollar worth of order?” Wynn laughed. Her tone was cold. She never counted on Philip to be able to help her with anything.</p>  <p id = > “It’s just a one million dollar order, I can-...” said Philip. He did not lack the money now. With just one sentence from him, he could even buy over Wynn’s company, much less a million-dollar project. It was a piece of cake!</p>  <p id = > “Philip, that’s enough. I don’t need you to worry about my troubles,” answered Wynn coldly before turning around and going back into the restaurant.</p>  <p id = > Don’t need me to worry? But, you’re my wife!Philip stared after Wynn with a bitter smile and then took out his phone.</p>      <h2 id =chapter-6 > Chapter 6</h2> <p id = > Philip casually made a call to George Thomas. “George, help me check for the latest projects that Wynn Johnston is handling within Beacon Pharmaceutical. Is there a million-dollar order? Let me know who is the client and the person in charge.”</p>  <p id = > From the other end came George’s respectful voice, saying, “Young Master, Beacon Pharmaceutical is one of the companies that the Clarke family invests in. I’ll get President Hall of Beacon to visit you personally.”</p>  <p id = > Huh? Beacon Pharmaceutical is actually one of the companies our family invests in? My dad is too awesome!</p>  <p id = > Philip suddenly regretted not inheriting the family business earlier.</p>  <p id = > “No need to. Investigate quickly and have the client smoothen the whole process so that they won’t give Wynn a hard time,” said Philip calmly.</p>  <p id = > “Young Master, I recommend you to just buy over that client’s company. You don’t lack the money,” George suggested.</p>  <p id = > What the f*ck! Buy over? As expected of a butler from a wealthy family. Oh George, old man, do you really talk this big now?</p>  <p id = > “It’s called being low profile, do you understand? If I wanted to buy it, would I have waited until now?” Philip answered indignantly.</p>  <p id = > “Alright, Young Master. Please give me ten minutes,” George said sheepishly.</p>  <p id = > As soon as he hung up, George immediately got his secretary to contact Beacon Pharmaceutical’s chairman, Derrick Hall.</p>  <p id = > When Derrick received the call from George’s secretary, he was trembling with excitement. “President Thomas, do you need me for something?” It was a call from the richest man in Riverdale City! The chairman of Apex Group! Countless people wished to have a meal with him.</p>  <p id = > “President Hall, it’s not me who wants something from you, but my young master.” George’s voice sounded calm through the phone, but his tone was forbidding. He was, after all, the richest man in Riverdale City! He had to sound respectful in front of the young master, but toward other people, he was the boss! And a boss naturally needed to behave like one.</p>  <p id = > “Young… Young Master?” Derrick was currently sitting inside the president’s office of Beacon Tower, stunned as he started to break out in cold sweat.</p>  <p id = > President Thomas’ young master! The richest man in the city still had a young master! That was just too scary!</p>  <p id = > “Then, what would the young lord like from me?” Derrick asked carefully, terrified of enraging George if he was not cautious enough.</p>  <p id = > “There’s a Wynn Johnston in your company. Who is the client she has been in contact with lately?” asked George.</p>  <p id = > Derrick knew Wynn Johnston. She was the deputy manager of the marketing department, a strong woman, and he had had his eyes on her for a long time now. But sadly, she was married, although it did not matter.</p>  <p id = > Derrick immediately jogged over to the marketing department with his head drenched in sweat. When the staff of the Beacon Pharmaceutical marketing department saw Derrick, they all kept quiet.</p>  <p id = > “Where is Deputy Manager Johnston?” asked Derrick.</p>  <p id = > “She went out for a business discussion,” a staff member answered.</p>  <p id = > “Who is the client?” asked Derrick.</p>  <p id = > “Manager Maury Warren of Victory Pharmaceutical,” the staff member answered.</p>  <p id = > Derrick brought the phone back up, turned around, and respectfully reported, “President Thomas, it’s Maury Warren from Victory Pharmaceutical.”</p>  <p id = > “Alright, got it.” George directly hung up after that. Next up, George used his own authority to give Victory Pharmaceutical a warning. He had served as a butler for so many years now, he could naturally figure out what his young master was thinking. This Maury Warren from Victory Pharmaceutical must have offended the young master.</p>  <p id = > Six minutes later, Philip who was making his way to the hospital received a call from George. “Young Master, everything has been taken care of.”</p>  <p id = > “Okay. Don’t tell Wynn about this, and shut everyone else up. I don’t want to hear even a peep about it,” said Philip.</p>  <p id = > “Understood, Young Master. Low profile.” George chuckled.</p>  <p id = > After hanging up, Philip looked at the hospital building in front of him and smiled bitterly. Oh, Wynn, you keep saying that I can’t help you. I’m telling you now that I can assist you with simply one sentence. If you ever found out one day that I’ve been supporting you, how would you react?</p>  <p id = > Moving back to the Western restaurant on the sixth floor of Hilton Hotel. Maury Warren had had too much to drink and now his hands were starting to misbehave.</p>  <p id = > “Deputy Manager Johnston, you just keep eating but you won’t touch your wine. Are you looking down on me?” Maury put on a long face, his voice sounding dark.</p>  <p id = > Wynn flashed an apologetic smile and explained, “Manager Warren, you’re mistaken. I’m just unwell these few days, so I can’t drink alcohol.” This shitty fatso keeps trying to touch me, he’s so irritating!</p>  <p id = > “Hmph! Since you’ve put it that way, I don’t think there’s anything for us to talk about anymore.” Maury snorted before threatening Wynn. “Deputy Manager Johnston, you should know that not only Beacon is trying to cooperate with us. There are a lot of people begging to see me.”</p>  <p id = > At his words, Wynn frowned and looked hesitantly at the red wine on the table. “Alright then, I’ll just have one glass,” said Wynn. She took the bottle of red wine and poured herself a glass.</p>  <p id = > Maury was all smiles as he looked at Wynn. This woman was so endearing under the dim lights.</p>  <p id = > Wynn drank the whole glass at one go. “Manager Warren, will this do? Let’s talk about our collaboration…”</p>  <p id = > “Deputy Manager Johnston, don’t be in such a rush. Why don’t we talk about this slowly upstairs?” Maury Warren revealed his real agenda for the night. Soon after he spoke, he put his hand onto Wynn’s thigh and wanted to go further in!</p>  <p id = > ‘Slap!’</p>  <p id = > Wynn had stood up directly and gave the man a furious slap. “Manager Warren, that’s enough!”</p>  <p id = > “You b*tch, how dare you slap me!” Maury glowered furiously and stood up. He lifted an arm and was about to slap Wynn when…</p>  <p id = > ‘Ring ring ring!’</p>  <p id = > The sound of a caller tone interrupted him. He grabbed his phone as he watched Wynn leave, roaring into his phone, “Who’s this?!”</p>  <p id = > “Maury Warren! Is that how you should be speaking to me?” On the other end came a similarly enraged roar.</p>  <p id = > “President Lewis, I’m sorry, so sorry. A few promoters kept calling me just now. What do you want with me?” Maury immediately sounded like an obedient little kid. This man, President Lewis, was the chairman of Victory Pharmaceuticals, his boss! What was he calling him for? Although the man had now ruined his plans, Maury did not dare to complain.</p>  <p id = > “You’re asking me? Did you deliberately try to trouble Deputy Manager Johnston on our collaboration?” President Lewis asked, sounding exasperated. Just one moment ago, he had received a call from the wealthiest man in Riverdale City, George Thomas. The man’s words were filled with provocation. Damn it, this Maury Warren! He had the audacity to offend such a prominent figure! Was he looking for trouble?</p>  <p id = > “President Lewis, how do you know about this?” Maury was stunned. Could Wynn have told on him? But, she was only a mere deputy manager of the marketing department, it was impossible for her to be in contact with President Lewis.</p>  <p id = > “You’re even asking me this? Are you trying to get yourself fired?” President Lewis flew into a fit of rage and roared, “Our collaboration with Beacon is approved! And you better apologize to Deputy Manager Johnston immediately, in person! Without her forgiveness, don’t even think about coming back to the company. You can just scram!”</p>  <p id = > ‘Thud!’</p>  <p id = > The call was ended and Maury Warren was flabbergasted! He could tell that President Lewis was really furious.</p>  <p id = > Without another word, he dashed out to chase after Wynn. “Deputy Manager Johnston, please wait!”</p>  <p id = > Maury was now behaving like an obedient child, lowering his head, bending over slightly with his hands held together to show his apology. “Deputy Manager Johnston, I’m so sorry, I was muddled earlier. I’ll sign our collaboration agreement immediately. I hope Deputy Manager Johnston can forgive me for being blinded by desire.”</p>  <p id = > Wynn was stunned. She stared at Maury in shock and confusion. “Manager Warren, do you mean it?” This was the order she had been working on for a whole month. A hundred thousand! Her commission alone was worth tens of thousands! They could finally pay Mila’s treatment fees.</p>  <p id = > In just ten minutes, Maury and Wynn signed the agreement. Everything happened so fast that Wynn still could not regain her senses.</p>  <p id = > “President Warren, you mentioned that your chairman has approved of this personally, right?” Wynn asked, feeling confused.</p>  <p id = > Maury had been giving her a flattering smile the whole time. “Yes, Deputy Manager Johnston. You should have told me that you were an acquaintance of President Lewis. We almost had a misunderstanding.”</p>  <p id = > Wynn nodded, still puzzled. How could she be acquainted with President Lewis of Victory Pharmaceutical? That must mean someone had helped her! Could it be Juan Parker? She had mentioned this to him in the morning.</p>  <p id = > I must ask him! thought Wynn. She subconsciously compared Philip and Juan in her mind and the contempt for Philip grew. Her husband was just too useless!</p>  <p id = > On the other hand, Philip was still not aware that after helping Wynn with her problem, the latter had misunderstood and thought that his rival, Juan, had helped her instead. If he found out about this, he might just vomit blood.</p>  <p id = > The next day in the afternoon, Philip got into a Bentley after leaving the hospital. He had made an appointment to meet someone with George today.</p>  <p id = > After Philip left in the car, a girl who was standing a little too far away mumbled suspiciously, “Why does that back profile look like Philip…”</p>  <p id = > Lynn Johnston was here at the hospital today to visit her cousin’s daughter. She had been unwilling to come, but her parents said that it was rude of her not to visit a Johnston family member.</p>  <p id = > However, upon reaching the hospital entrance, Lynn happened to witness Philip getting into the car. But, she assumed that her worthless cousin brother-in-law could never afford a luxurious car like a Bentley, so Lynn never gave it another thought and went into the hospital’s inpatient department.</p>  <p id = > Inside the moving Bentley, Philip asked lazily, “George, who are we meeting today? Are they troublesome?”</p>  <p id = > George answered respectfully, “Young Master, it won’t be troublesome. He’s a collector in our country, considered a friend of mine.”</p>  <p id = > “Why am I meeting your friend then?” Philip asked, instead. Good ol’ George, is this a reenactment of the brokeback mountain? You’re already at this age, and you’re still getting involved in things like this?</p>  <p id = > George was all smiles. “Young Master, this is only a small business worth a billion. You need to learn from experience so you can inherit the family fortune as soon as possible.”</p>  <p id = > This answer made Philip look up at George. A business worth a billion was a small business? He held back the urge to roast him and said, “George, do you know how the cow died?”</p>  <p id = > Oh no, after not meeting for seven years, this old thing was getting more and more pretentious. As the heir of an elite family, Philip had the misconception of being frightened.</p>          <h2 id =chapter-7 > Chapter 7</h2> <p id = > The Bentley soon arrived at Riverdale Virtuous Court. This was a famous restaurant in the city where only the wealthy and prestigious could dine. Virtuous Court also required a membership reservation where the minimum requirement was to spend at least one million to keep the membership.</p>  <p id = > At that moment, standing at the entrance of Virtuous Court was a well-known entrepreneur. The chairman of Civil Trading Group, Russell Field. The company specialized in import and export business, mainly dealing with artistic pieces. As the company chairman, Russell himself was a wealthy man worth three billion! He was also a nationally famous collector! A well-known figure within the local collector’s community.</p>  <p id = > Russell had brought more than ten personnel from his highest management to wait respectfully at the entrance of Virtuous Court with him. This scene caused quite a shock to the patrons dining at the restaurant. There were even bursts of exclamation.</p>  <p id = > “Isn’t that the chairman of Civil Trading Group, Russell Field? Who is he waiting for with this extravagant display?”</p>  <p id = > “What a rare sight! A billionaire like Russell is waiting so humbly at the door or Virtuous Court.”</p>  <p id = > “Is there a prominent figure coming? Whoever it is, they must not be from Riverdale.”</p>  <p id = > The moment Philip saw a crowd of well-dressed elites waiting at the entrance of Virtuous Court, he frowned inside the Bentley. “Didn’t I say to keep a low profile? What’s with this extravagant display?”</p>  <p id = > George smiled sheepishly. “Young Master, President Field must have wanted to give you a surprise.”</p>  <p id = > “Surprise my foot! I don’t like it,” said Philip coldly. “Head to the parking lot and inform your friend to meet us in private.”</p>  <p id = > “Understood, Young Master.” George nodded.</p>  <p id = > The car drove away into the parking area.</p>  <p id = > Russell had been standing tall in front of Virtuous Court as he was patiently waiting for the guest of honor today. He had gone to shamelessly beg his friend for this opportunity.</p>  <p id = > Standing beside him was his son, Tyler Field. The young man had his hands stuffed in his pockets as he spoke, sounding displeased, “Dad, just who are we waiting for? Aren’t they too arrogant? It’s already been twenty minutes.”</p>  <p id = > Russell shot a sideways glare at Tyler and said in a hushed voice, “Behave yourself. If they show up and you make a mistake, just see how I’ll take care of you later.”</p>  <p id = > Tyler let out a disgruntled snort, feeling more upset. He had already made plans with his friends to go clubbing, but his old father had dragged him over to meet some big-shot investor. However, there was not a shadow of the person even after this grand display.</p>  <p id = > Just then, Russell received a phone call and then solemnly turned around. “Alright, everyone, let’s go inside. They are already here.”</p>  <p id = > Already here? Many of them were confused but mostly annoyed.</p>  <p id = > Tyler was more furious. He grumbled under his breath, “What the f*ck? Who is this person? I’ve waited for a whole day now, but I didn’t even catch a glimpse of them.” However, he did not dare say anything in front of his father, so he could only sulk and follow Russell into the restaurant.</p>  <p id = > Once Russell received the phone call, he took his son along and hastened to the private room in a corner.</p>  <p id = > The moment the door was pushed open, Tyler saw two people standing inside, but his gaze fell on Philip.</p>  <p id = > The f*ck? Is this that big-shot investor? Dad can’t be this blind, can he? Which part of this guy looks sophisticated? He looks like a migrant worker in the streets.</p>  <p id = > Tyler could not resist a snigger as his dissatisfaction grew. It was thanks to this guy that he could not go out and have fun.</p>  <p id = > Instead, Russell had reached out with both his hands and a face full of smiles as he went toward George, who was standing with a walking stick.</p>  <p id = > “President Thomas, you’re finally here.”</p>  <p id = > George smiled and nodded, extending only one hand for the other man to shake.</p>  <p id = > Russell’s gaze then turned to the young man standing beside George. “This is…?”</p>  <p id = > “This is my young master, Young Master Clarke. He’s also the investor this time around.” George introduced with a smile.</p>  <p id = > Young… Young Master? George Thomas, President George’s young master?!</p>  <p id = > Russell was a company president, and he was worth three billion. He was also a prominent figure in Riverdale City. Although he could not compare to George, who was worth more than ten billion, he was at least acquainted with the world.</p>  <p id = > It was said that George Thomas came from working for a hidden wealthy family. And that family was in control of more than half of the world’s assets. That must mean that the young master of this family was of a fearsome existence! He had to be very cautious.</p>  <p id = > At the thought of this, Russell held out his hands in great trepidation. “This humble servant, Russell Field, has been too dense to recognize Young Master Clarke. I hope that Young Master Clarke can forgive me.”</p>  <p id = > Philip nodded faintly and shook his hand before saying, “President Field, I still have some things to take care of, so let’s make this quick. I heard from ol’ George that your company requires financing. Give me a figure.”</p>  <p id = > Russell glanced at George, but he realized the latter had been resting his eyes. Russell then said, “Young Master Clarke, our company is preparing to open up the art pieces market to international countries. The channel sales in America and Italy have been doing extremely well, so as an estimation, we would require one billion in financing as an estimation. Please don’t worry. We will give you 25% of the shares and a bonus at the end of the year.”</p>  <p id = > One billion was not a very small amount. Even if Russell was worth three billion, he dared not gamble away his one billion.</p>  <p id = > “One billion…” Philip mumbled, frowning slightly as he seemed to be in deep thought.</p>  <p id = > This made Russell anxious on the inside. To ask for one billion at the start was a little too much. Other than Apex Group, there might not be another person in Riverdale City capable of helping.</p>  <p id = > However, Philip’s next words stunned Russell for the longest time. Even Tyler who had been looking down on Philip ever since he entered the room was shocked!</p>  <p id = > “I’ll invest two billion, but I want 40% of the shares.” Philip smiled like he was merely talking about numbers.</p>  <p id = > Two billion? Was this a dream? Russell felt like he was being watched over by Lady Luck. What a surprise this was!</p>  <p id = > His company assets only amounted to a little over three billion, but they had easily offered to invest two billion dollars! Scary! This was too terrifying! Was this the financial power of the hidden elite?</p>  <p id = > 40% of the shares were still an acceptable condition for Russell. “Young Master Clarke, are you sure you want to invest two billion?” Russell was barely able to speak from the excitement, but he still calmed himself down immediately to ask.</p>  <p id = > “Too little? I can add a bit more,” said Philip casually.</p>  <p id = > A... a little more?!</p>  <p id = > Russell could barely stand straight now. He quickly answered, “No, no, two billion is enough.”</p>  <p id = > It had to be enough. With these two billion, Russell had full confidence that he could conquer both the American and Italian markets. By then, his own company would be able to go up to over ten billion!</p>  <p id = > Russell then got his secretary to hurry in with an exquisite long box in hand. Russell took out a scroll from the box, unrolled it, and smiled. “Young Master Clarke, this is an authentic painting by the famous Tang Bohu of China. I’ve kept it for many years now, and today I’d like to present it to you as a token of my appreciation.”</p>  <p id = > As a famous art collector within the country, the paintings Russell gifted were naturally authentic! In the market, an original Tang Bohu painting could go up to over ten million in worth!</p>  <p id = > However, for Russell, in comparison to Philip’s investment, this painting was worth nothing.</p>  <p id = > Philip merely glanced at it and nodded. “You have my thanks, President Field.” He then held the rolled-up painting under his arm and left the private room with George.</p>  <p id = > The moment they exited the room, Philip saw a middle-aged man donned in a full suit coming over with a smile on his face. “Young Master Clarke, please wait. I am the owner of Virtuous Court, Javier Morris.”</p>  <p id = > Both Philip and George stopped in their tracks, looking at the middle-aged man in confusion.</p>  <p id = > When Javier saw George standing behind Philip, he felt a huge shock! It was true! President Field had been right! The young man who could have the wealthiest man in the city stand beside him was indeed extraordinary.</p>  <p id = > “Young Master Clarke, President Thomas, I didn’t know that both of you were coming, so I have failed to welcome you. This is the platinum VIP membership card of Virtuous Court. If Young Master Clarke doesn’t mind, please take this,” said Javier. He was set on making Philip’s acquaintance tonight!</p>  <p id = > Philip looked at Javier briefly before taking the membership card and said in a casual tone, “Thanks.”</p>  <p id = > After that, he shuffled his feet to start walking again, leaving the rest to ol’ George to take care of.</p>  <p id = > George waited for a bit before saying to Javier, “Mr. Morris, my young master doesn’t like to be too conspicuous. If anybody asks…”</p>  <p id = > “Understood, understood! President Thomas, please don’t worry. No other soul besides me will know of Young Master Clarke’s identity.” Javier immediately guaranteed.</p>  <p id = > Back to Philip. Once he left Virtuous Court, he did not choose to ride inside George’s Bentley but was about to rent a bicycle. However, the moment he stepped out of the door, he coincidentally ran into Wynn Johnston!</p>  <p id = > Shit! How was he going to explain meeting her here?</p>  <p id = > “Philip, what are you doing here?” Wynn was leading a group of well-dressed men and women as they appeared at Virtuous Court.</p>  <p id = > As she was staring suspiciously at Philip, the latter quickly explained in panic, “I’m here for a delivery.”</p>  <p id = > Delivery? Food delivery to a restaurant?</p>  <p id = > Wynn frowned slightly, her expression cold. She was starting to get irritated when she saw his weak appearance. What made her even more anxious was letting her colleagues see Philip.</p>  <p id = > However, a hostile male voice suddenly spoke up at this moment. “Deputy Manager Johnston, is this delivery man the husband of yours? He looks only so-so. As expected of a kept man.”</p>                                 <h2 id =chapter-8 > Chapter 8</h2> <p id = > This voice was unpleasant. Philip lifted his head and saw a fat man with a protruding beer belly staring at him with a mocking expression.</p>  <p id = > What does it have anything to do with you, whether or not I’m a kept man? Do I even know you? Philip pouted, planning to ignore him, turned to leave.</p>  <p id = > The fatso, however, did not plan to let him off so quickly. He went over to block Philip’s way and ridiculed him indirectly. “Ignoring people now? Great personality! I heard that your business failed, and now our Deputy Manager Johnston is the one paying for your living expenses. A grown man like you has some nerve to become a kept man.”</p>  <p id = > Philip frowned, looking extremely displeased. He recognized this man, Gavin Zach, the marketing manager at Wynn’s company. The man had tried to harass Wynn, and Philip had taught him a lesson. And now that he saw Philip in a low place, the man started to mock him unscrupulously.</p>  <p id = > Wynn’s other colleagues were now looking at Philip with a weird look in their eyes. They, too, knew a little about Philip, who had been an enthusiastic entrepreneur but had now dropped to the low status of a delivery man.</p>  <p id = > Wynn stood among the crowd, frowning hard as she looked at Philip and felt embarrassed.</p>  <p id = > “Philip, go back quickly,” said Wynn.</p>  <p id = > When Gavin heard this, he raised an eyebrow as the disdain in his eyes grew thicker. The other colleagues snickered. Even his wife was embarrassed by him now. What a failure of a man!</p>  <p id = > Philip did not want to stay for a minute longer, so he turned to leave. But Gavin would not let it happen. “Don’t go, Philip. Why don’t you have a meal with us? Your wife just signed a one hundred thousand dollars worth of contract yesterday, something you can never achieve with ten years of delivery service. Don’t you want to celebrate together?”</p>  <p id = > A hundred thousand dollar contract? So, Wynn managed to get it. Philip already knew, but he did not plan on staying. Even his wife was urging him to leave, so why should he wait to bring contempt upon himself? Oh, Wynn, if only you knew that I was the one who has facilitated this contract of yours, what reaction would you have?</p>  <p id = > “No need. I still have to go to the hospital,” said Philip calmly.</p>  <p id = > Gavin did not allow him room to reject and simply dragged Philip into the restaurant, even draping an arm around his shoulder and said, “There’s no need to be shy. Your wife is treating, after all. It’d be a waste not to eat.” You’re just a kept man, who are you to be picky?</p>  <p id = > And so, the crowd entered Virtuous Court with Philip being forced to stay. However, he was standing alone in a corner while Wynn was huddled around her colleagues as they chatted excitedly about how she had managed to close the deal.</p>  <p id = > “Deputy Manager Johnston, you mentioned that you closed this deal because someone has helped you?” One of the beautifully dressed women asked in shock.</p>  <p id = > Wynn nodded. “Manager Warren of Victory Pharmaceuticals was giving me a hard time. You guys, too, know that he had been trying to ask me out for meals. But yesterday, after getting a phone call, he suddenly said that he would sign the contract and had even sincerely apologized to me.”</p>  <p id = > As she spoke, Wynn subconsciously looked at Philip who was standing absentmindedly in a corner. She could not help but feel sad and disappointed. She had hoped that that person would be Philip, but she knew that it was impossible.</p>  <p id = > “Wow, who’s this that has a crush on our deputy manager? To even help you with this hundred thousand contract!” That woman squealed intentionally in a loud voice so that Philip would hear.</p>  <p id = > Look at you, you worthless thing! Your wife is being courted, but you’re still standing there like an idiot! How useless!</p>  <p id = > As the crowd chattered happily, Gavin walked over with a conflicted expression and said, “We can’t eat here. They require reservations, and only members can walk-in.”</p>  <p id = > Gavin could not believe that Virtuous Court actually required reservations and that a membership application required minimum spending of one million annually! Those who could spend a million to dine here were wealthy!</p>  <p id = > Wynn stood up immediately with a troubled expression and said, “What do we do? Shall we switch to another place?’</p>  <p id = > She had promised to treat everyone today, but to think this place required a reservation… It was Wynn’s first time here, and a colleague had even suggested it.</p>  <p id = > “Huh? Are you serious, Manager Zach? We’ve come all this way!”</p>  <p id = > “Manager Zach, think of something. I heard that the food at Virtuous Court is especially delicious.”</p>  <p id = > “If it really can’t be helped, then let’s switch to someplace else.”</p>  <p id = > Some of them were starting to get upset and made a fuss. Gavin was feeling helpless. He had done so much just to win Wynn Johnston’s favor. But, where was he going to get this million-dollar membership card?</p>  <p id = > “Why don’t we switch to Noble Manor? This place requires a reservation, so I can’t do anything.” Gavin shrugged.</p>  <p id = > The woman who had been speaking loudly earlier was Rose Stewart, Gavin’s secretary. It was as the saying goes, ‘if there was something to be done, the secretary will do it; if there was nothing to be done, do the secretary.’</p>  <p id = > Rose shifted her long legs, moving to Gavin to hook onto his arm as she said coquettishly, “Manager Zach, it’s my first time here. Didn’t you say that you know the manager here? Get him to open up an extra table for us.”</p>  <p id = > Upon hearing this, Wynn and the other colleagues turned to look hopefully at Gavin.</p>  <p id = > The latter was now in an awkward position. He did not know any manager. He was only bragging when he said that.</p>  <p id = > “Uhm… Isn’t that a little inappropriate? Let’s not trouble them and move to Noble Manor. It’ll be my treat,” Gavin answered immediately.</p>  <p id = > Noble Manor was not as pricey. A meal for seven or eight pax would cost only about a thousand. He even went with the flow and offered to treat, so perhaps Wynn would thank him for this.</p>  <p id = > However, a few of the colleagues were visibly upset.</p>  <p id = > Rose glanced at Wynn and said in dissatisfaction, “Deputy Manager Johnston, you promised to treat us to Virtuous Court, so isn’t this a little too disappointing?” Rose was envious of Wynn. The woman was deputy manager at such a young age and was favored by both Manager Gavin and President Hall.</p>  <p id = > Why? Just because she’s pretty? Aren’t I pretty? I’m not just pretty, so why don’t these stinky men care that much for me?</p>  <p id = > “Alright, alright, Deputy Manager Johnston didn’t know that this place required reservations either. Let’s go to Noble Manor,” Gavin quickly spoke up for Wynn. His tone was firm.</p>  <p id = > Wynn bowed to apologize. “I’m sorry, I’ll treat Noble Manor. I was supposed to treat anyway, so I don’t want to trouble you, Manager Zach.”</p>  <p id = > A few colleagues shot cold glances at Wynn before turning away to leave unhappily. They were all filled with anger now, so who cared about eating anymore!</p>  <p id = > Just as the crowd entered this downcast atmosphere, a voice broke the silence.</p>  <p id = > “I have a membership card. Do you guys want to use it?” Philip who was standing in a corner spoke.</p>  <p id = > He could not resist, after all. Wynn was still his wife, and to watch her being dismissed by her colleagues made him uncomfortable.</p>  <p id = > “You have a membership? Philip, it wouldn’t kill you if you didn’t lie. Do you know where this is? Virtuous Court! Membership requires a minimum spending of one million a year!” Gavin’s ambiguously, sinister words could be heard. The colleagues around him, too, looked at Philip disapprovingly as mockery crept into their expressions.</p>  <p id = > Wynn, too was stunned. She stared at Philip awkwardly before going over to tug at him, wanting to pull him away as she said in a hushed voice, “What are you doing? Go back to the hospital to keep Mila company.”</p>  <p id = > Are you trying to chase me away because you’re afraid I’d embarrass you? Philip did not explain. Since she did not want his help, then he would leave.</p>  <p id = > However, Gavin was amused and laughed scornfully. “Deputy Manager Johnston, what’s the rush? Since your husband says he has a membership card, just let him book a table for us.” The mockery was apparent on Gavin’s face. He just wanted to watch Philip make a fool of himself.</p>  <p id = > Didn’t he hear just now that a regular silver membership card in Virtuous Court required minimum spending of one million a year? Doesn’t matter. Just let him make a fool of himself in front of everyone. That way, Wynn would probably be very disappointed with him. And that means I’ll have a chance to make the cut!</p>  <p id = > “Philip, stop fooling around! Hurry up and go back!” Wynn said coldly, trying hard to suppress the rage inside her heart. Why did he have to pop up at a time like this? Was it fun to be this shameful?</p>  <p id = > She already could not raise her head whenever her colleagues talked about her husband, and now he was adding fuel to the fire. This was driving her crazy!</p>  <p id = > “Wynnie, I do have a membership card,” said Philip calmly. He then dug out a card from his pocket and waved it in front of everyone.</p>  <p id = > Gavin and the group were shocked. Did he really have a card?</p>  <p id = > However, after a little thought, Gavin’s expression looked even more taunting.</p>  <p id = > “Philip, this isn’t the membership card for delivery men, is it? It won’t be right to con someone with this.” Gavin mocked ignorantly.</p>  <p id = > However, Philip was looking at Gavin with a straight face like he was staring at an idiot. This irked Gavin. Why was he so calm? Could the card be real? Impossible!</p>  <p id = > Just then, Rose went over in her high heels, swiped the card from Gavin’s hand and laughed arrogantly. “Since Deputy Manager Johnston’s husband says it’s a membership card, let’s try it.” She then took the card to the front desk.</p>  <p id = > Wynn could not stop her in time when this happened. She could only stomp her foot in anger and glared furiously at Philip. “Philip, you’re just too disappointing!” This man was still trying to put on an act at a time like this! And now that his lie was about to be revealed, not only would he be shamed, she too would have to face the same!</p>  <p id = > The mockery on Gavin and their colleagues’ faces grew even more.</p>  <p id = > “Come, come, come, we’re benefiting from Philip’s association today, so let’s see if the reservation gets through.”</p>  <p id = > Gavin was ecstatic, impatient to watch Philip make a fool of himself. He had prepared a lot of things to say so he could ridicule him later. A few others snickered as they surrounded Philip and Wynn, escorting them to the front desk like they were afraid that both of them would run away.</p>                                      <h2 id =chapter-9 > Chapter 9</h2> <p id = > At the front desk, Rose was waving the card as she swept an arrogant glance at Philip before saying, “Help me check if this card can reserve us a private room.”</p>  <p id = > Everyone was holding their breaths, waiting to watch Philip make a fool of himself.</p>  <p id = > The girl at the front desk received the card, swiped it, and all of a sudden, her expression looked nervous. She asked, “Miss, is this your card?”</p>  <p id = > When Rose saw this, she shook her head. Extending her hand with red painted nails, she pointed to Philip, who was being surrounded and laughed tauntingly. “It’s not mine. It’s his.” Haha! What a joke! Philip is going to make a fool of himself, and Wynn would lose all face along with him! This is too great. There’s actually a man who would publicly ridicule himself.</p>  <p id = > Rose was dying of happiness. She glanced happily over at Wynn who was looking sullen and mocked, “Deputy Manager Johnston, your husband sure is an excellent man.”</p>  <p id = > Wynn was extremely embarrassed. She shot a vicious glare at Philip, ready to reprimand him when the girl at the front desk suddenly ran out. She then stood respectfully in front of Philip and said very politely, “Sir, you are our restaurant’s platinum member. There is a special room specially reserved for you. Please follow me.”</p>  <p id = > The mocking snickers around them immediately stopped!</p>  <p id = > That all happened too suddenly!</p>  <p id = > Everyone could not regain their sense.</p>  <p id = > What was happening? A special room…?</p>  <p id = > Rose was the first to speak, agitated as she pointed at Philip and nagged, “Hey, hey, hey, are you mistaken? He’s your restaurant’s platinum member?”</p>  <p id = > “Take a closer look. He’s a delivery man. A kept man even! How could he be a platinum member?”</p>  <p id = > Gavin, too, was dumbstruck. He had prepared a lot of sarcasm, ready to unleash! But this sudden revelation of Philip being a platinum member caught him off guard that he felt a lump stuck in his throat.</p>  <p id = > Wynn was looking at the female staff, confused, and then turned to look at Philip. Was her husband a platinum member at Virtuous Court? She just heard from Gavin that a regular membership required one million in annual spending. Did that not mean that a platinum membership would cost at least a few million?</p>  <p id = > The female staff smiled politely and said, “I’m not mistaken. This is a platinum card, and our restaurant has issued only eight pieces where each cardholder has a private room specially reserved for them.”</p>  <p id = > “Woah!” The crowd gasped. One private room for each cardholder! This was a service fit for a king! Was this… still Wynn’s wretched husband?</p>  <p id = > “Sir, this is your card. Please follow me,” said the staff respectfully.</p>  <p id = > Philip took the card then looked at the crowd who was staring wide-eyed and gritting their teeth at him. He explained, “It’s not mine, it belongs to my company’s boss. I’m just here to make a reservation.”</p>  <p id = > Phew! Upon hearing Philip’s explanation, Gavin and Rose let out a sigh of relief. So, it was just a case of jobbery, taking his boss’s card to put on a front. F*ck! Rose’s knees even went weak from the shock.</p>  <p id = > Gavin shot Philip a furious glare then taunted, “And here I was wondering why, so it was just dishonest advertising.”</p>  <p id = > At this, the others sniggered. But, since the room has been reserved, it was a waste not to use it.</p>  <p id = > Philip did not explain. He only said to Wynn faintly, “Take them to dinner. I’ll go back first.” Then, without waiting for Wynn to persuade him to stay, Philip had already walked out of Virtuous Court with the box of painting in his hands.</p>  <p id = > Although Wynn felt terrible, she could not resist her colleagues’ urges, and they followed the staff into the private room.</p>  <p id = > Gavin and Rose naturally did not enjoy this dinner very much because it was only made possible by Wynn’s useless husband.</p>  <p id = > A few moments after Philip had left Virtuous Court. He received a short message from Wynn: Thank you.</p>  <p id = > Philip looked at it and smiled, replying: No problem.</p>  <p id = > Philip still felt guilty toward Wynn. He was actually the heir to the world’s largest consortium, but because he was unwilling to inherit the family business, he had come to Riverdale City to experience being poor.</p>  <p id = > So, when would he tell Wynn about this? Maybe after a little while.</p>  <p id = > After renting a bicycle, Philip headed for the hospital.</p>  <p id = > On the way there, as Philip made a right turn, a motorcycle came speeding his way!</p>  <p id = > The buzzing sounds of the motorcycle’s engine rang in his ears, and in an instant, Philip felt a strong breeze beside him as the motorcycle swerved right. Following a crashing sound, the riders and the bike fell into the grass beside the road.</p>  <p id = > “Oh no!” Philip tossed his bicycle away and rushed over to see if the occupants of the bike were hurt.</p>  <p id = > A man and a woman climbed up from the grass. The woman’s black skirt had been torn by the tree branches and she looked frightened. The man had his hands on his waist as he bellowed, “Are you trying to kill yourself? F*ck!”</p>  <p id = > Philip quickly apologized, “I’m sorry, I didn’t see you there. Are you guys alright? Do you want to go to the hospital? I’ll compensate for the bike.”</p>  <p id = > Upon hearing this, the man exploded in a fit of rage and started scolding Philip. “This is a Harley-Davidson Sportster Iron 883 Custom! It’s worth two hundred thousand! Can you afford to compensate for it?”</p>  <p id = > Philip answered, “I’ll compensate you three hundred thousand. The hundred thousand is for medical expenses.”</p>  <p id = > The man broke into a sarcastic laugh before giving Philip a furious shove. “You think you have a lot of money? Three hundred thousand? Can you pay up? What are you pretentious for?!”</p>  <p id = > Philip staggered backward from the shove. He frowned and said, “You’re the ones running a red light. I’m already kind enough to not argue with you on that, don’t push it!”</p>  <p id = > Philip was not in the wrong for turning right. The rider was just trying to run a red light. If they were to be reasonable, it was the rider’s fault.</p>  <p id = > “You said I’m running a red light? Which eye did you see it with?” The biker let out a sudden outburst and roared.</p>  <p id = > Just then, the girl behind him finally regained her senses. She took off her helmet, looked at Philip, and screeched, “Why are you here?”</p>  <p id = > Philip looked at the source of the voice to realize that the girl was Lynn Johnston!</p>  <p id = > The atmosphere immediately became awkward.</p>  <p id = > “Brother Jacob, don’t let him off so easily!” Lynn shouted harshly.</p>  <p id = > This man was Jacob Wells, the son of a wealthy man.</p>  <p id = > As Philip looked at Lynn, feeling a little hesitant, Jacob pointed at Philip’s nose and asked Lynn, “Do you know him?”</p>  <p id = > Lynn nodded, glaring at Philip. “My cousin brother-in-law, but we’re not close. He’s a kept man.”</p>  <p id = > “Shit! A kept man was trying to act all pretentious in front of me? Are you tired of living?” Jacob scolded before taunting Philip, saying, “Alright then, didn’t you say you would compensate three hundred thousand dollars? Pay up!”</p>  <p id = > A contemptuous smirk appeared on Lynn’s cold expression. Three hundred thousand? Hah! Where would useless trash like Philip find three hundred thousand?</p>  <p id = > Philip had initially wanted to pay up, but now he did not want to. “I don’t feel like it anymore because you guys were the ones running a red light.”</p>  <p id = > If Lynn had not been here, Philip might have paid up to settle the matter quietly. But now, he could not do so.</p>  <p id = > Lynn let out a cold laugh. “Haha! I think you just don’t have the money. Weren’t you doing really well in your act earlier? Why back down now?”</p>  <p id = > Jacob roared, “Three hundred thousand! Pay up or I’ll call some guys over.”</p>  <p id = > Call some guys over? Philip was not at all afraid.</p>  <p id = > “Call them then,” said Philip calmly.</p>  <p id = > “Alright, you’re a tough brat! Don’t run away in shock later!” threatened Jacob as he pointed at Philip. The former then took out his phone to make a phone call, sounding furious as he said, “Brother Kyle, bring some men over to Silverstone!”</p>  <p id = > After hanging up, Jacob stared straight at Philip and said, “My bros will be here soon. Get ready to beg.”</p>  <p id = > Philip looked indifferent. There was no telling what he was thinking.</p>  <p id = > He finally let out a helpless sigh and took out his phone to call Agnes Summer. “Agnes, bring some men over to Silverstone. The more, the better!”</p>  <p id = > As soon as he hung up, Jacob practically split his sides with laughter. “Hahaha! You’ve called someone too? Hilarious! Okay, let me see just who you managed to get.”</p>  <p id = > Lynn was only watching quietly at one side. Philip had been staring at her for a few times now, making her uncomfortable.</p>  <p id = > What was Philip thinking? He was, of course, thinking that Wynn’s cousin sister was really awesome to be able to change boyfriends so quickly. He should tell Wynn so that she could school her cousin. If she did not learn at a young age, she would get into trouble in the future.</p>  <p id = > At Gopher Delivery Services, Agnes immediately spread the word after getting the call from Philip.</p>  <p id = > In an instant, all the delivery men in the city under Gopher Deliver Services got onto their standard red scooters, put on their bright red vests and helmets, and drove past streets and alleyways, heading for Silverstone! From an aerial view, it looked like countless red dots were moving slowly to assemble at Silverstone.</p>  <p id = > Back at Philip’s side, the men that Jacob called for were already here.</p>  <p id = > Four Harley Davidsons! There were eight people, a mix of men and women, all wearing stylish biker outfits, looking very cool and fashionable.</p>  <p id = > They had driven over with deafening buzzing sounds of their bikes. Their leader was a 1.8 meter tall and handsome man. He was buffed, sporting a buzz-cut, and very handsome.</p>  <p id = > “Jacob, what’s going on? Your ride’s trashed.” Kyle Lyon strode over obnoxiously with his group in tow. He swept a glance and Philip, easily figuring out the situation. “You did this?” Kyle asked in a deep voice as he stared at Philip.</p>  <p id = > Philip kept quiet.</p>  <p id = > “Brother Kyle, it’s him alright! Don’t let him think about leaving without coughing up three hundred thousand!” Jacob called out from the background.</p>                                <h2 id =chapter-10 > Chapter 10</h2> <p id = > Philip glanced over calmly and expressionlessly.</p>  <p id = > Kyle was looking at Philip, clearly displeased. This guy seemed so normal, how could he be so calm? Interesting!</p>  <p id = > “Bro, can you pay the three hundred thousand?” Kyle was not a gangster who would just start getting physical for no apparent reason. Three hundred thousand was a humongous sum for a normal person. Kyle felt that a man like Philip could never afford this amount, but he still had to ask. Diplomacy before violence.</p>  <p id = > “I’m sorry, but he ran a red light and should take full responsibility. What’s more, we didn’t really hit each other,” said Philip calmly.</p>  <p id = > Jacob pointed at Philip and roared furiously, “Does that mean you won’t pay up?”</p>  <p id = > Philip stared quietly at him, not answering.</p>  <p id = > Kyle frowned slightly, shifting his gaze to the wrecked Harley on the ground and said, “Bro, three thousand won’t cost much. Just a leg.”</p>  <p id = > This was a threat. Philip’s gaze went cold as a glint appeared in his eyes.</p>  <p id = > As the heir to an elite family, did that three hundred thousand matter to him? It did not. But, he could not let himself be taken advantage of.</p>  <p id = > “What if I told you I don’t have any money?” Philip replied.</p>  <p id = > The group of bikers was snickering as they stared at Philip like he was an idiot.</p>  <p id = > Kyle rubbed his nose before draping an arm over Philip’s shoulder, flashing him an insolent smile. “Uncle, do you know who I am? I’m Kyle Lyon of Lord North Street. Everyone shows me respect by calling me ‘Brother Kyle’. It would be unreasonable if you didn’t compensate for a single thing today.”</p>  <p id = > Kyle was amused. It was his first time meeting such a foolish guy. Was his head made of iron? Or did he think he was a honey badger? Hilarious!</p>  <p id = > “Brother Kyle, just one look at his outfit, and you can tell that he’s broke.”</p>  <p id = > “This idiot might not even know what a Harley is, hahaha!”</p>  <p id = > “Uncle, quickly call someone to bring you some money. Our Brother Kyle doesn’t hold back in a beating.” The group of bikers jeered continuously. The girls crossed their arms with an indignant expression while the guys leaned against their bikes, smoking.</p>  <p id = > Lynn was among the group, watching coldly. She leaned against one of the girls who was wearing tight leather pants and a cropped camisole.</p>  <p id = > “He’s my cousin brother-in-law, a wretched piece of trash living under my cousin sister’s expenses.” Lynn suddenly interrupted, saying this like it made her seem more superior.</p>  <p id = > “Shit, a kept man! Uncle, you have quite the skills. Why don’t you teach us?” A few of the bikers started cracking up again.</p>  <p id = > Kyle stifled a laugh and shook his head. He scorned men who relied on women the most. “So, what is your decision, Uncle?” asked Kyle. He smirked and was ready to get physical.</p>  <p id = > Philip remained silent without saying a word. A mental calculation told him that it was about time.</p>  <p id = > All of a sudden, Philip’s pupils contracted as he saw a great number of red-colored scooters speeding over from afar!</p>  <p id = > “Why are there so many delivery men?” Without knowing who shouted, everyone turned to look.</p>  <p id = > The sight of red scooters, red helmets, and red vests filled their eyes. It was not just ten units. The whole crossroad was filled with the red delivery service fleet! There were almost fifty units! The scooters immediately surrounded this whole area.</p>  <p id = > “Shit! What gives? They’re all cheap scooters!” yelled Jacob. He then turned to Philip and asked, “Did you call for them?”</p>  <p id = > Philip nodded. “Yeah.”</p>  <p id = > “Hahaha!” There was a burst of laughter.</p>  <p id = > “You think that calling a bunch of delivery men over would be useful?” Jacob laughed out loud as he belittled.</p>  <p id = > Kyle was too lazy even to ridicule him, only shaking his head. Was this guy really an idiot? To actually have the guts to do such an embarrassing thing. Was this a popular method nowadays? To call for delivery services to save yourself. It was hilarious.</p>  <p id = > Lynn was among the biker’s team. When she saw this scene, she could not resist laughing out loud. This cousin brother-in-law of hers was just too much. How could her cousin have fallen for such a man? He was garbage!</p>  <p id = > Just then, from among the delivery fleet, Agnes came out in a black skirt suit. Under the headlights of the scooters, she walked toward Philip.</p>  <p id = > Philip only gave her a signal with his eyes and Agnes understood. Philip had explicitly told her before that his identity was not to be revealed. This man was really low profile.</p>  <p id = > Agnes then turned around to face Kyle and his group, saying leisurely, “I am Philip’s manager. If you have a problem with him, you can talk to me.”</p>  <p id = > Kyle’s eyes scanned Agnes up and down. This woman was exquisite. She was better than the young girls around him.</p>  <p id = > “Okay, I’ll talk to you then,” Kyle answered happily. “Three hundred thousand. Once we get the money, he can leave.”</p>  <p id = > Agnes frowned slightly. She looked at the Harley on the ground and said coldly, “Sure. But, we choose to settle it with a police report.”</p>  <p id = > Police report? Kyle frowned immediately.</p>  <p id = > The police were the most troublesome existence for a biker gang. Moreover, what happened tonight was mostly Jacob’s fault. If they made a police report, he would not have it well. The most important thing was Kyle did not bring his driving license out today.</p>  <p id = > “Babe, talks don’t work this way. It’s too insincere.” Kyle’s expression darkened. The people behind him started cracking their knuckles.</p>  <p id = > However, the moment they took a step forward, the delivery men in red vests around them rolled up their sleeves furiously, ready to dole out a beating. How could they still negotiate? It was ten people versus over forty greasy grown men. There was nothing left to negotiate!</p>  <p id = > Kyle knew that this situation was not favorable for him. He gritted his teeth and said, “Fine. You win in numbers. Let’s go.” He then led his group onto their modified bikes and drove away.</p>  <p id = > While they were still in view, Kyle lifted a middle finger at Philip. Lynn had shot Philip a cold glare, despising him even more. What was he arrogant about? A shitty delivery man like him actually needed a woman to fight for his honor. Serves him right to be a kept man for the rest of his life!</p>  <p id = > After the biker gang had disappeared into the distance, Agnes finally let out a sigh of relief. She turned to ask respectfully, “Boss, are you okay?”</p>  <p id = > The crowd of brothers started chiming in to ask about his well being too.</p>  <p id = > “I’m fine, I’m fine, you guys can head back now,” said Philip.</p>  <p id = > After making sure that Philip was alright, Agnes led the team away.</p>  <p id = > This crisis went away as quickly as it came. Philip got onto his bicycle and went back to the hospital. Wynn had come to the hospital later that night and got into bed with Mila after freshening up. Philip, instead, sat on the long bench outside the ward to pass the night.</p>  <p id = > ***</p>  <p id = > Today was the old man, Charles Johnston’s birthday. After giving it some thought, Philip decided to make a trip over. As for his birthday present, Philip had brought along the Chinese painting, that Russell had gifted to him. Russell was a famous collector within the country, so the paintings from him were definitely genuine and could fetch a high price.</p>  <p id = > However, Philip knew that whatever gift he brought, it would still be scorned upon. But he did not mind it. It was just a token of his regard.</p>  <p id = > At the entrance of Virtuous Court, the place where Wynn had said to meet up, a beautiful silhouette of a woman was standing beside the door, evidently anxious.</p>  <p id = > Wynn Johnston had especially worn a long black dress today with her hair combed up. She looked gorgeous and elegant. But, this woman was cold to Philip.</p>  <p id = > Philip walked over, lazily, and teased, “Hey, are you waiting for me?”</p>  <p id = > Wynn frowned and shot Philip a look of disdain. “Did you bring a gift for my dad?”</p>  <p id = > Philip showed her the long gift box in his hand. “Yeah, I did.”</p>  <p id = > Wynn did not even bother to look and just turned around to strut into the restaurant in her high heels. She had to beg her father for a long time before she was allowed to bring Philip along.</p>  <p id = > “Once we get inside, don’t say anything rash. A lot of my family members and my father’s friends are here today, and if they say anything about you, just bear it. You just have to remember one thing today, that is to apologize to my parents. If you can do that, I won’t divorce you,” urged Wynn.</p>  <p id = > Philip chuckled, not taking her words to heart. If the old man knew of his identity, he might have been so frightened that he would come out to receive him at the door.</p>  <p id = > Seeing Philip keep quiet, Wynn looked back and glared at him, asking sternly, “Do you understand?”</p>  <p id = > “Got it,” answered Philip.</p>  <p id = > When the two of them entered the private room, the Johnston family and Charles’s friends have already gathered. It was lively inside.</p>  <p id = > “Look who’s here, the Johnston’s great beauty.”</p>  <p id = > “Wynn, you’re late today, so you have to drink as a penalty.”</p>  <p id = > “Sister Wynn, sit with me.”</p>  <p id = > The crowd was ardently greeting Wynn and completely ignoring Philip who was following closely behind her. He regretted coming now.</p>  <p id = > Although Philip was already used to the Johnston family being cold to him, to be publicly ostracized was still upsetting.</p>  <p id = > Charles Johnston and his wife, Martha Yates, were sitting at the head of the table, talking cheerfully to the people around them. However, when they saw Philip, Charles gave a cold snort before ignoring him altogether.</p>  <p id = > This son-in-law was too much of an embarrassment. There were not only family members here today but his friends as well. If it were not for his daughter, Charles would never have let Philip take one step inside.</p>  <p id = > Just then, the door of the private room was pushed open again and a well-dressed man in a branded full suit stood at the door.</p>  <p id = > Philip had seen this man once or twice before. The man was from a wealthy family. His family had a solid background and was an influential bunch in Riverdale City. This man had also been pursuing Wynn for a long time now.</p>                <h2 id =chapter-11 > Chapter 11</h2> <p id = > Sigh! His wife was just too beautiful that so many people were trying to court her. It gave Philip a headache.</p>  <p id = > “Hey, Aiden’s here! Come, come, come and sit beside your Uncle Johnston.” Martha was clearly enthusiastic as she welcomed him. “Why did you have to bring gifts? You’re just too kind. Just your presence would have been enough!”</p>  <p id = > “It’s Uncle Johnston’s birthday, after all.” Aiden smiled and walked over to sit beside Charles.</p>  <p id = > At this, the crowd started shooting mocking looks at Philip. This son-in-law of the Johnston family was just too wretched. Even an outsider could sit beside Charles Johnston, but as a son-in-law, he had to sit closest to the door. This difference in treatment was just too obvious.</p>  <p id = > Martha was smiling with her eyes as she looked at Aiden like she was looking at her future son-in-law. “It’s thanks to Aiden reserving this private room that we get to dine here at Virtuous Court today.”</p>  <p id = > The crowd then looked at Aiden in adoration. To be able to reserve a private room at Virtuous Court was a member’s only privilege. And that membership required a minimum spending of one million annually! He was truly a wealthy man!</p>  <p id = > Aiden quickly waved his hand. Although he sounded modest, he could not conceal the pleased look on his face. “Oh, it’s nothing. It’s no trouble at all. Our company just earned a little more, and it is really thanks to my father that I have managed to book this room.”</p>  <p id = > He was blatantly just showing off this wealth and family background. However, no one would expose him. Instead, they ardently complimented him.</p>  <p id = > “Aiden is a competent young man.”</p>  <p id = > “Whoever gets him as a son-in-law must have great karma.”</p>  <p id = > Aiden was immediately shown great respect and admiration. Philip, who had been sitting quietly in a corner, was instead looked down upon. They were both men, but the differences were too great.</p>  <p id = > “The way I see it, if Wynn had married Aiden back then, she would’ve been a rich wife by now.”</p>  <p id = > No one knew who had said this deliberately, but the family members were now taking great pleasure in mocking Philip.</p>  <p id = > “Look at his wretched appearance, how vexing.”</p>  <p id = > “A good-for-nothing that only knows how to make deliveries!”</p>  <p id = > “I heard his daughter is a medicine junkie. She has congenital heart disease and can’t be cured.”</p>  <p id = > Those familiar words from familiar faces made Philip’s eyes turn cold, but he did not say anything. He had already gotten used to it for the past two years.</p>  <p id = > Wynn did not have it any better. Her face was burning as she sat beside her husband. She stomped furiously on Philip’s foot under the table and shot him a glare to vent her frustrations.</p>  <p id = > After being ridiculed by everyone, Philip could actually still sit there like he was fishing. His expression looked calm. Seeing as Philip did not respond, the others went back to their drinks, no longer ridiculing him as an amusement.</p>  <p id = > Just then, with a seemingly caring expression, Aiden asked, “Philip, I just happen to have a vacancy in my company. Why don’t you come over and help out? I should be able to give you six or seven thousand a month. It would definitely be better than making deliveries.”</p>  <p id = > “That’s okay. I’m doing very well with my delivery job,” said Philip calmly. If I told you that I’m the heir to the world’s largest consortium, you’d all be kneeling in front of me right now. But money is just a number.</p>  <p id = > “Forget him, he’s a lost cause,” scolded Martha before turning to look at Aiden with bright eyes. “Aiden, what about that matter I’ve asked you about before?”</p>  <p id = > Aiden immediately replied with a smile, “Aunty, you can relax, it’s been taken care of. Uncle Johnston’s collection gallery is fine.”</p>  <p id = > Charles, who had been fuming earlier, immediately perked up at this. He smiled, “Little Addy, thank you so much. Come, let’s drink.”</p>  <p id = > The two then toasted. After his drink, Aiden purposefully looked at Philip from the corner of his eyes, trying to look as arrogant as he could. His eyes then shifted longingly to Wynn. He had liked this girl for the longest time, but she had actually gone and married a piece of trash! Wynn Johnston, I will make you understand the difference between that useless Philip and me!</p>  <p id = > “Wynn, see how much Aiden cares for your father. A man like this can’t be found easily anywhere, and others can’t even begin to compare.” Martha was extremely pleased with Aiden. The man was from a wealthy family, had a business of his own, and a great network in society. If her daughter had married him, she would definitely be able to live leisurely.</p>  <p id = > Martha then shot a hateful glance at Philip.</p>  <p id = > Wynn was already dejected enough, so she could only force out an awkward smile.</p>  <p id = > Philip, however, could not care less. They could just say whatever they want.</p>  <p id = > “Charles, is it about your personal collection gallery?” Many of Charles’s friends were looking at him with envy. Collecting ancient artifacts and paintings was a norm in their little circle. However, to be able to build one’s own collection gallery was a grand matter.</p>  <p id = > When Charles saw the jealous look on his friends’ faces, he felt even more delighted and his favor for Aiden increased. At the same time, he looked down on Philip even more. He wondered why he had agreed to let Wynn marry him in the first place. But now, he must force his daughter to divorce this wretched man!</p>  <p id = > Halfway through the feast, Aiden seemed to have recalled something and ran outside. He came back with a long gift box in his hand and said to Charles, sounding like he was flaunting, “Uncle Charles, I brought you a special gift. I’m sure you’ll like it.”</p>  <p id = > Everyone in the room perked their heads up, curious about what was inside Aiden’s long gift box.</p>  <p id = > Charles had had a lot to drink. He was already in a great mood about being able to start his own collection gallery, and now that Aiden was giving him a gift, it was a surprise on top of another surprise! He was ecstatic!</p>  <p id = > “Oh, Addy, look at you. You’ve reserved a room for me, prepared the gallery, and even given me a gift. It’s just too inappropriate.” While Charles seemed to be refusing the offer on the surface, he was impatient to see what was inside the box. Since Aiden had said he would like it, could it be a painting?</p>  <p id = > Aiden opened the gift box and carefully brought out a scroll of painting. He sounded pleased as he said, “It’s the painting from China’s famous Tang Bohu. I’ve spent a lot of effort to buy it from a friend to give it to Uncle Charles as a birthday gift.” Aiden then raised an eyebrow to glance cheekily at Philip, who had his head buried in his plate.</p>  <p id = > This piece of trash still has the mood to be eating at a time like this. Is this his first time at Virtuous Court?</p>  <p id = > However, in that instant, Philip felt his heart drop. Companionship on the Spring Mountains? That was the same painting that Russell Field had given him. But, Philip believed that as a famous collector in the country, Russell would not have given him a fake, so he did not plan to say anything but only push his gift box under the table to keep it hidden.</p>  <p id = > Wynn noticed Philip’s movements and asked with a frown, “What’s wrong?”</p>  <p id = > Philip shook his head. “Nothing.”</p>  <p id = > “Companionship on the Spring Mountains?” Charles was shocked, instantly sobering up. That was a treasure! There were many paintings by Tang Bohu, but only this piece, had had a lot of counterfeits on the market. It was said that this painting was bought over by a great collector within the country at a high price! The amount had easily started at around three to four hundred thousand dollars!</p>  <p id = > Charles took the painting from Aiden with great sincerity and excitement. He went over to an empty table, unreeled the painting, and borrowed a magnifying glass from the waiter to start examining it carefully.</p>  <p id = > A few of his friends crowded around him and started examining it as well.</p>  <p id = > Tsk! Tsk! How extraordinary!</p>  <p id = > “Wonderful! This painting is a fusion of the south and north drawing style. What fine brushwork and a sparse layout. The style is handsome and elegant. The figures have inherited the traditions of the Tang Dynasty in this brightly colored and elegant piece. This freehand brushwork is simple and deep. It’s no doubt a piece by Tang Bohu!”</p>  <p id = > Charles’s old pals were all collectors. After seeing this piece, they only had compliments to give.</p>  <p id = > “Wonderful, how wonderful! To be able to lay eyes on this is a miracle!”</p>  <p id = > “Charles, you’re going to be famous around the country now.”</p>  <p id = > “You have to display this painting in your upcoming gallery. We’ll definitely come over to support you, and I think all the prominent figures in Riverdale will be coming too!” The bunch of old friends was really envious.</p>  <p id = > Charles was so excited that his breathing quickened. He asked, “Addy, this is an authentic painting from Tang Bohu! You must have spent a lot on this.”</p>  <p id = > These words stunned the whole room. As the head of the four great talents in China, Tang Bohu’s authentic painting was worth a lot! Just last year in a city auction, calligraphy by Tang Bohu went up to seven hundred thousand!</p>  <p id = > “It’s not much as long as it makes you happy, Uncle Charles.” Aiden was well-mannered enough to not mention the price. But, those who understood knew that this painting would not cost less than five hundred thousand! This young man of the Grant family had spent a fortune this time!</p>  <p id = > Just then, among the crown, Lynn deliberately asked loudly, “Cousin brother-in-law, I saw you bringing something with you. Is it a gift for my uncle?”</p>  <p id = > As soon as they entered, Lynn had noticed Philip carrying a gift box. Just how much would a gift from this trash worth? When she recalled the incident last night, Lynn was furious.</p>  <p id = > ‘Swish!’</p>  <p id = > In an instant, all eyes in the room were on Philip. With a mocking expression, they were ready to watch the show.</p>  <p id = > Philip smiled awkwardly. “It’s not worth much, so there’s no need to look at it.”</p>  <p id = > “I know it’s not worth anything, but since it’s a gift for Uncle, why don’t you show it? Do you think we will laugh at you?” Lynn’s eyes narrowed, unable to conceal the mockery on her face. She wanted to watch him make a fool of himself, and see just what he could afford to give!</p>  <p id = > “I don’t think there’s a need to.” Philip took a sip of water and refused.</p>  <p id = > In the public’s eye, they thought he felt guilty. That gift must be rubbish.</p>  <p id = > Aiden was already waiting for this chance to humiliate Philip, so he interrupted and said, “Philip, take it out, humor Uncle Charles. I’m interested to see what you’ve prepared as well.”</p>  <p id = > “Yeah, take it out and show us.” The crowd of people started to cause a commotion.</p>      <h2 id =chapter-12 > Chapter 12</h2> <p id = > Watching everyone causing a commotion, Wynn felt like she was sitting on needles. Although she did not know what Philip had prepared, he had told her that it was a painting.</p>  <p id = > Philip was not a complete idiot, so he had brought the painting that Russell had given him. But sadly, Wynn did not know. She only thought that Philip had simply bought a random decorative painting. Now that Aiden had brought out his famous Chinese painting and received great comments from everyone, the painting in Philip’s hand paled compared to a treasure like that. He would be humiliating himself if he took it out.</p>  <p id = > “It’s just a gift. There’s nothing to see.” Wynn chirped in for Philip before shooting him a vicious look. If he humiliated himself in front of everyone today, she would hate him forever! She would never be able to lift her head up again in front of Aiden.</p>  <p id = > “Sis, you’re just rude now. We can’t ignore Cousin Brother-in-law’s regards,” Lynn giggled as she said. She then walked over and snatched the long gift box from under the table that Philip had kept hidden.</p>  <p id = > “Hey, it’s also a long gift box. Could it be a painting as well?” Lynn deliberately dragged her tone as she filled it with sarcasm.</p>  <p id = > Philip did not know what to say, so he just kept quiet.</p>  <p id = > “You didn’t buy this from a two-dollar shop, did you?”Lynn shook the gift box and taunted.</p>  <p id = > “I bought it from an antique market,” said Philip.</p>  <p id = > As soon as he said that, the people in the room glanced oddly at Philip. An antique market? How shameful! They were looking at Philip with laughter in their eyes.</p>  <p id = > Charles, however, relaxed a bit, changing his views on Philip. This son-in-law at least knew of his hobbies, so it was already good enough. But that was all. Compared to the treasure that Aiden had gifted him earlier, something from an antique market was not worth mentioning.</p>  <p id = > “Hahaha! How amusing! Did you buy this from an antique market? Aren’t you just being disrespectful to Uncle?” Lynn mocked. “I’ve heard that goods from an antique market are all counterfeits, and most of them are just dirty.”</p>  <p id = > This term ‘dirty’ struck a nerve. Charles’s expression immediately fell dark. He could understand the usage of that word in the inner circle. It was true that a lot of goods from the antique market were ‘dirty’. If one was not careful when buying, it would bring about misfortune. Charles then snorted while the positive view he had for Philip earlier disappeared.</p>  <p id = > Wynn quickly stood up to snatch the gift box back from Lynn’s hand. “Then, don’t look at it.”</p>  <p id = > “That won’t do. We have to look at it. I’m curious to see what he has bought.” Lynn turned around and hastily opened the gift box to take out the painting scroll inside.</p>  <p id = > A painting? When the crowd saw this, their gaze alternated between Philip and Aiden. It was no wonder Philip did not want to take it out. What painting could compare to that treasure earlier?</p>  <p id = > Lynn was amused to see the mocking looks on everyone’s faces and then Wynn’s dark eyes. She unreeled the scroll with a swift movement, and the painting appeared in front of everyone’s eyes.</p>  <p id = > The crowd craned their necks to look at it and was first captivated by the exquisiteness of the painting. The character portrayal was rich, the colors bright, and the lines were soft and delicate. It was a great piece! But the more they looked at it, the more confused they got.</p>  <p id = > “This… Isn’t this the exact same painting as Aiden?” A young lad among the crowd exclaimed with wide eyes.</p>  <p id = > In an instant, everyone came to realize that this was the exact same painting, ! With a turn of their heads, they looked at Philip.</p>  <p id = > Was this a joke? He just bought a ? This was clearly a counterfeit!</p>  <p id = > The moment the painting was exposed, Aiden already recognized that it was the same painting as his. He was initially stunned, but after that, he laughed coldly. Even the heavens are on my side, hahaha! Oh, Philip, you’re done for! To bring a counterfeit for the old man as a birthday gift is a brave move!</p>  <p id = > Lynn purposefully shrieked loudly, “Cousin Brother-in-law, why is your painting the exact same one as Brother Aiden’s? Could yours be fake?”</p>  <p id = > Everyone had the same first thought. Philip’s painting had come from an antique market, so it must be fake!</p>  <p id = > “How do you know that it’s fake?” Philip’s voice suddenly rang through the whole room.</p>  <p id = > The crowd was first stunned, and then they stared incredulously at Philip. Was this guy nuts? Among these two paintings, one was by Aiden, who had spent a few hundred thousand to get it while the other was bought in an antique market. It was easy to tell which was real and which was fake.</p>  <p id = > Wynn nervously kicked Philip under the table, signaling him to stop saying nonsense. She had already told him before they came here, asking him to tolerate, so why did he not listen? He was really embarrassing!</p>  <p id = > Lynn immediately laughed out loud. “Philip, are you saying that your painting is the authentic one? That Brother Aiden’s is fake?” Hilarious!</p>  <p id = > “Maybe,” Philip added, completely ignoring Wynn, who was pinching him under the table.</p>  <p id = > “Hahaha!” The crowd laughed out loud, shaking their heads helplessly as they looked down on him even more.</p>  <p id = > Charles, at the head of the table, snorted coldly, completely giving up on this son-in-law of his.</p>  <p id = > “If that’s the case, why don’t we get Uncle Johnston and the uncles here to take a look at it?” asked Aiden, looking very pleased with himself.</p>  <p id = > He was confident. He had spent around two million to buy it from a friend. To think Philip was trying to steal his spotlight with a counterfeit that cost about ten bucks from an antique market! Dream on!</p>  <p id = > Lynn immediately took Philip’s painting to Charles and the few uncles who were all collectors. “Uncles, please take a look.”</p>  <p id = > Charles took it unwillingly. After a few glances, his eyes widened! His other friends too quickly took up the magnifying glass to get closer looks after sweeping a few glances at it. The more they looked, the more surprised they felt.</p>  <p id = > This… this drawing style definitely belonged to Tang Bohu! This painting looked genuine too. But that was weird. These two paintings looked so identical like they were printed from the same copier.</p>  <p id = > Charles and his friends exchanged glances and then bent over the table to study it closely again, not letting go of even a single detail.</p>  <p id = > At this scene, everyone was shocked. Could that useless Philip’s painting be the real thing?</p>  <p id = > Aiden was starting to panic as well. Uncle Charles’s expression looked like he was seeing the real thing. But it was impossible! He had spent two million dollars. It could not be fake!</p>  <p id = > Wynn’s heart had already leaped up to her throat. She looked at Philip to see that he was sitting there quietly, looking calm like there was nothing to worry about.</p>  <p id = > “Philip, where did you buy this from? This counterfeit is really well made, it could almost be passed off as the real thing,” Charles said through narrowed eyes.</p>  <p id = > “This counterfeit is really well made. If we weren’t here, this could have really been passed off as the real thing,” Charles’s other friends chimed in.</p>  <p id = > To be honest, they were not sure themselves, but they impulsively leaned toward Aiden’s painting because his painting was expensive.</p>  <p id = > Upon hearing this, everyone let out a sigh of relief as they looked down on Philip even more. It was a fake, after all!</p>  <p id = > Aiden, too, felt relieved as he looked cheekily at Philip.</p>  <p id = > Philip frowned his expression looking a little odd. Was the painting Russell gave him a fake? But that was impossible. Was he passing off the fake as a genuine piece?</p>  <p id = > Philip immediately realized that the old men must have noticed that the two paintings were just too similar, but they leaned toward Aiden’s piece. The reason was probably because Aiden was from a wealthy family while he was the broke son-in-law, so how could he have afforded the real thing?</p>  <p id = > At this, Philip shook his head helplessly and gave up.</p>  <p id = > Lynn, however, laughed out loud and mocked, “Philip, you’re really something. Who were you trying to cheat with a counterfeit?” She then mocked her cousin, “Sis, your husband is really something. He thought he had actually gotten the real thing.”</p>  <p id = > It was the first time, but Charles was speaking up for Philip. “That’s enough, Lynnie. Philip can’t be blamed for this. He was only buying it. He didn’t know how to check the authenticity.”</p>  <p id = > The group of people did not continue, but they started distancing themselves from Philip even more, thinking that it was shameful to dine with such a person.</p>  <p id = > Wynn could not take another bite. She pulled Philip away immediately. “Of all things, why did you have to give a fake painting? I’m completely humiliated by you!” Wynn accused him furiously.</p>  <p id = > Philip could only lower his head. “I’m sorry.”</p>  <p id = > “This is so frustrating! I get more annoyed whenever I look at you. Go back and take care of Mila!” Wynn bellowed through gritted teeth before returning to the private room.</p>  <p id = > Philip stared after her disappointing silhouette and let out a soundless sigh. Oh, Wynn, my painting was the real one. But sadly, these people can’t tell.</p>  <p id = > When Wynn returned to the room, everyone else noticed that Philip did not follow her in. Martha asked, “Where’s Philip?”</p>  <p id = > Wynn forced out a smile and answered, “Mila’s still in the hospital, so he has gone back first.”</p>  <p id = > Haha! Must have fled because he was too embarrassed.</p>  <p id = > Just then, the door was pushed open, and Javier Morris led in several waitresses who were carrying various exquisite delicacies and fine wine.</p>  <p id = > “You must be Mr. Johnston.” Javier walked over to Charles and politely shook his hand.</p>  <p id = > “You are?” Charles was stunned. He did not know this man.</p>  <p id = > “I am the owner of Virtuous Court, Javier Morris. Today is Mr. Johnston’s birthday, so I’ve specifically brought over some special dishes prepared by our French, German, and English chefs. Here are eight bottles of Lafite from 1982 and two bottles of Chinese National Treasure Liquor,” said Javier with a smile.</p>  <p id = > The crowd looked at the plates of delicacies and fine wines being placed on the table and were all too shocked to speak!</p>  <p id = > The owner of Virtuous Court had personally come to deliver gifts! This was too shocking. The 1982 Lafites were already extremely rare. There were even two bottles of China’s nationally treasured liquor! They were the most expensive liquors available in the market, and one bottle could go up to two million in an auction! It was a drink fit for a king!</p>  <p id = > “Here is a platinum membership card as a little token of my regard for Mr. Johnston. You will have a specially reserved room the next time you dine here and a five percent discount.” Javier took out a membership card and ceremoniously handed it to Charles.</p>  <p id = > By now, Charles was already too shocked for words. He could only reach his hand out shakily and asked, “Mr.- Mr. Morris, thank you so much, but we don’t really know each other. Who sent you here?”</p>  <p id = > “Is Mr. Clarke not here?” asked Javier as he scanned the room. He did not see Philip anywhere.</p>  <p id = > Mr. Clarke? Charles was stunned. No one in this whole room had ‘Clarke’ as the last name, and no one thought of Philip.</p>  <p id = > Wynn was dumbstruck. She had immediately thought of Philip, but that was impossible.</p>    <h2 id =chapter-13 > Chapter 13</h2> <p id = > “Since Mr. Clarke isn’t here, I won’t disturb you any longer. Please have a great time.” Javier had come so suddenly and left after delivering gifts, leaving the crowd shocked.</p>  <p id = > Charles coughed with the card still in his hand and asked, “Does any of you know this Mr. Clarke?”</p>  <p id = > Everyone shook their heads. A figure powerful enough to have the owner of Virtuous Court personally bring over delicious food and great wine was not someone they could be acquainted with their lowly status.</p>  <p id = > “Could it be Philip Clarke?”</p>  <p id = > No one knew who had said this for fun, but the whole room burst into laughter.</p>  <p id = > “Stop joking, how could it be that trash? If it were him, I’d eat these wine bottles.”</p>  <p id = > “Other than having the same last name, what else does our cousin brother-in-law have to show for?”</p>  <p id = > A few of the youngsters were mocking without reserve.</p>  <p id = > Wynn found it hard to bear, so she scolded furiously, “That’s enough! What are you guys saying? He is still your cousin brother-in-law no matter what!”</p>  <p id = > Tsk! A few of the youngsters cocked up their eyebrows arrogantly but said nothing more.</p>  <p id = > Charles chimed in and asked everyone to stop making a fuss.</p>  <p id = > Charles’ friends were now extremely envious of him.</p>  <p id = > “Charles, my man, how could you? You know such a powerful figure, but you didn’t introduce him to us.”</p>  <p id = > “This too much. First, it’s a treasured painting. Now, there’s a ‘Mr. Clarke’.”</p>  <p id = > “Come, come, come, forget about all those. These are precious liquors, a king’s drink, waiting to be tasted.” Charles felt it a waste to consume them all now, so he kept one bottle and opened the other. The others did not say anything because being able to have one taste of those liquors was enough to last them a lifetime.</p>  <p id = > Just then, Aiden said, “Uncle Johnston, I might know this Mr. Clarke. The boss behind the art gallery has ‘Clarke’ as the last name. Could he have known that it was your birthday today, that’s why he has sent the gifts?”</p>  <p id = > Aiden was only guessing, but the boss of the gallery was named ‘Clarke’. Although he had never met him before, the secretary who liaised with him told him that the man’s name was ‘Clarke’ and he hoped to keep a low profile.</p>  <p id = > “Really? Then, I must thank Mr. Clarke properly. He’s just too kind.” Charles was visibly excited. He then tugged Aiden’s arm and said, “Addy, you have to arrange a meeting for me with this Mr. Clarke. I can tell that he’s also a collector.”</p>  <p id = > “I will, surely,” Aiden happily promised. To be able to be held in such high regard by Uncle Johnston was worth the labor.</p>  <p id = > “Sigh, some people have the same last name but they work as a delivery man,” Lynn spoke up at an inappropriate time, and it was like a thorn stabbing into Wynn’s heart.</p>  <p id = > Wynn gritted her teeth, took one sip of her drink, and then stood up. “Dad, I’m going to visit Mila at the hospital. I’ll be taking my leave now.”</p>  <p id = > Charles knew that it would just be torture for his daughter to keep staying here, so he waved to allow her to leave. The distance between his daughter and himself had grown a lot in the past two years. This was all thanks to that useless Philip.</p>  <p id = > “Sis, are you in a rush to get back? Remember not to scold our cousin brother-in-law,” Lynn continued to mock. “His gift was quite nice, although it’s a fake.”</p>  <p id = > Wynn had just reached the door when she heard this. She clenched her fists and left without ever looking back.</p>  <p id = > As soon as she left, the group started discussing this mysterious Mr. Clarke while belittling Philip.</p>  <p id = > Not long after he had left Virtuous Court, Philip received a text message: Mr. Clarke, this is Javier Morris. Everything is going well, and your father-in-law is delighted.</p>  <p id = > Javier Morris? Oh, right, the owner of Virtuous Court. It seemed like this Javier Morris really knew how to win favors.</p>  <p id = > Philip replied: I won’t look into how you managed to get my phone number, but you better not have exposed my identity in this incident.</p>  <p id = > When Javier received Philip’s reply, he quickly responded out of fright: Mr. Clarke, don’t worry. I definitely did not.</p>  <p id = > Philip nodded without replying to him after that and headed to the hospital.</p>  <p id = > Back at the hospital, Philip sat down at the side of the bed as he watched his adorable daughter sleep. Her tiny nose looked like her mothers, her little mouth too, but her eyes looked like his own.</p>  <p id = > My daughter is so good-looking, she’ll definitely be a beauty when she grows up!</p>  <p id = > Not long after Philip arrived, Wynn came back with a frosty expression. She sat down at the side of Mila’s bed and looked at her daughter.</p>  <p id = > Philip had just come back from getting water at the pantry. When he saw Wynn, he smiled and said, “You’re here. I can take care of things here, so go back home to get some rest.”</p>  <p id = > Wynn kept quiet as she looked at her daughter with reddened eyes. It seemed like she was trying very hard to suppress her emotions.</p>  <p id = > “What’s wrong?” Philip noticed Wynn’s odd behavior.</p>  <p id = > “Philip, do you plan to let Mila stay this way? Don’t you want her to get better treatment? Didn’t the doctor say that as long as we can pay one million, Mila can get her surgery done?” Wynn’s eyes were completely red. “Mila’s three years old now. It’s the best time for her to get treatment.”</p>  <p id = > Philip looked at the sleeping little girl and said, “I know. I’ll find a way.”</p>  <p id = > “Find a way? What ways can you possibly think of?” Wynn scoffed as tears rolled down from her eyes. “Philip, I’m begging you, apologize to my parents, okay?”</p>  <p id = > “Wynn, trust me. I have a solution,” said Philip. My dear, you just don’t know that I’ve already done something. Mila is the daughter to the heir of the world’s largest consortium. She is a heavenly child, a noble young lady.</p>  <p id = > “Solution? Other than embarrassing me, what else can you do?” Wynn accused Philip furiously. “At my father’s birthday today, forget giving him a cheap gift, why did you have to give him a painting? It was even a counterfeit! Do you know what they’re saying about me? I’ve had enough of you Philip Clarke, can’t you think of me and Mila a little more?”</p>  <p id = > Philip knew that Wynn had experienced a lot of hardship and grievances in the past two years. They have been mocked and ridiculed, but he had his reasons that he could not help it. However, now that he had inherited his family fortune, things were going to be different.</p>  <p id = > “Wynnie, trust me. I will definitely give Mila the best treatment, and I will definitely make up to the hurt that you’ve been feeling for the past two years.” Philip hugged Wynn’s shoulders but the latter pushed him away.</p>  <p id = > Wynn was extremely disappointed. He was always saying this, but not once did it come true.</p>  <p id = > “Enough, I don’t want to hear anymore. I will discharge Mila and take her with me tomorrow. I will find a solution myself.” Wynn wiped her tears and said resolutely.</p>  <p id = > “Wynnie, I’m actually…” Philip could not resist. But the moment he spoke, Wynn shot him a glare.</p>  <p id = > “You’re what? You’re a useless piece of trash!” said Wynn icily. Philip was then pushed out of the ward while Wynn stayed inside with Mila.</p>  <p id = > In the long quiet corridor outside the ward, Philip recalled how disappointed Wynn had looked at him. Wynn, I’m actually the son of the world’s wealthiest man. I have trillions in assets.</p>  <p id = > Philip left the hospital himself and called George. “George, how is the arrangement going for my daughter’s treatment?”</p>  <p id = > On the other end, George respectfully answered, “Young Master, it’s already been taken care of. In a few days, the internationally famous cardiologist, Professor Henry Turner, will come to Riverdale City. I will arrange for him to come to the hospital to perform surgery on the young miss on the pretense of giving a lecture.”</p>  <p id = > “Okay, I’ll leave it to you. Make it as natural as possible without any fuss,” said Philip.</p>  <p id = > “Don’t worry, Young Master, your identity won’t ever be revealed. It will be a coincidence. After the surgery, I’ve arranged a funding activity, especially for children with congenital heart disease. That way, no one will suspect a thing.”</p>  <p id = > George added, “Oh, right, Professor Turner heard that you are in Riverdale City and would like to meet you alone.”</p>  <p id = > “We’ll talk about that when the time comes,” replied Philip before he hung up. He was in a bad mood now.</p>  <p id = > George then called another number. “Henry, old pal, I’ve already informed my young master, so the rest will be up to your performance.”</p>  <p id = > On the other end, inside the president’s office of Turner’s Hospital at Golden City, Henry Turner abruptly stood up from excitement after receiving George’s phone call. “Great, great, great! Thank you, Brother George, I’m indebted to you.”</p>  <p id = > After he ended the call, a young doctor sitting on the sofa inside Henry’s office asked immediately, “President Turner, who was the call from that made you this happy?”</p>  <p id = > Henry chuckled out loud. “Director Stanley, in three days, I will go to Riverdale City. There’s a special patient that requires surgery, so we have to bring along our best doctors. Go and make the arrangements.”</p>  <p id = > Director Stanley said ‘okay’ and went off to get ready.</p>  <p id = > Philip got another call after he had hung up. It was from a woman with a sweet voice, sounding like the spring breeze.</p>  <p id = > “Hello Mr. Clarke, this is Anna Carter from Civil Gallery. The gallery has now been transferred to your name, and Mr. Charles Johnston’s personal gallery event has been set for Saturday. Would you like to come and take a look?”</p>  <p id = > Philip had been reluctant to go, but after some thought, he answered, “Alright, I’ll take some time off to visit.” It was, after all, the old man’s personal collection display. He had to make sure it was perfect.</p>  <p id = > “Alright, Mr. Clarke, I will make the arrangements.” Anna’s sweet and gentle voice added, “Oh, yes, Mr. Clarke, the liaison in charge of this event, Mr. Aiden Grant, would like to request an audience with you. Should I make the appointment?”</p>  <p id = > Aiden Grant? Right, almost forgot that he said he would arrange for it. Tee-hee. He would never have guessed that the gallery he had been racking his brains to rent was bought over by me, Philip Clarke, to rent it to him especially. Should I meet him or not?</p>               <h2 id =chapter-14 > Chapter 14</h2> <p id = > Philip pondered before saying, “I won’t meet him for now. Let’s talk about it in the future.”</p>  <p id = > Anna replied, “Understood, Mr. Clarke.”</p>  <p id = > After the call ended, Philip sat in the corridor and slept the night away.</p>  <p id = > The next day, early in the morning, Wynn said to him coldly, “I’m taking Mila home in the afternoon, will you be coming with me?”</p>  <p id = > Philip nodded and gave her a bitter smile. “I’ll go and apologize to Father.”</p>  <p id = > Wynn’s heart skipped a beat when she heard him, but her expression remained indifferent, only nodding without saying anything.</p>  <p id = > In the afternoon, Philip and Wynn brought Mila to the Johnston family home. The atmosphere in the house was cold as soon as they entered.</p>  <p id = > “Dad, I’m home.” Wynn feigned composure.</p>  <p id = > No one came out to greet them. Charles was sitting on the sofa wearing reading glasses as he read the paper while Martha was busy in the kitchen.</p>  <p id = > Philip put Mila down, and the little girl immediately hid behind her father’s leg, hugging Philip’s leg tightly. She looked up with her big innocent eyes and mumbled in a small voice, “Daddy, do Grandpa and Grandma dislike me?”</p>  <p id = > Philip squatted down and lovingly caressed Mila’s tiny head. He shook his head and smiled gently at her. “That’s not true. Hurry on inside and greet Grandpa and Grandma.”</p>  <p id = > Little Mila’s big eyes were shining like obsidian gems. She carefully albeit fearfully glanced at Charles, who was reading his paper before moving her tiny feet to run to him, calling out in a crisp voice, “Grandpa, Mila is here.”</p>  <p id = > Charles then put down his paper, stood up, walked away from his sofa, and entered the study without giving her so much as a glance.</p>  <p id = > Bam! The door of the study closed shut. That sound crushed down heavily on both Philip and Wynn’s heart.</p>  <p id = > Wynn looked at Mila, who was pursing her lips, about to cry and quickly ran over to carry her daughter up. She brought her into her bedroom.</p>  <p id = > Philip frowned slightly, feeling irked. His father-in-law was too cold to his daughter! But he still went into the kitchen to help, although he ended up being scorned by his mother-in-law.</p>  <p id = > “Philip, I don’t need you to help me. I really don’t. You can just go back to where you came from. We don’t welcome you here,” Martha said without reserve, not showing Philip any courtesy.</p>  <p id = > “Mom, I’m sorry.” Philip lowered his head. He knew what he had come here to do today, and he did not want to give Wynn any trouble, so he chose to compromise.</p>  <p id = > “Oh dear me, I can’t possibly accept that.” Martha scoffed. She mildly cocked her eyebrows up as she wore an arrogant expression.</p>  <p id = > Just then, the doorbell rang.</p>  <p id = > Martha shot Philip a glare before rudely pushing him away as she ran to the door, looking delighted. In a cheery voice, she called out, “Coming, coming! Is it Aiden?”</p>  <p id = > When the door opened, Aiden appeared in a handsome suit with gift bags in his hands. “Hello, Aunt Martha.”</p>  <p id = > “Oh my, come on in, quickly,” Martha chirped happily as she took the gift bags from Aiden. “Why did you have to bring gifts with you, you’re too kind.”</p>  <p id = > “It’s my first time visiting, so it’s the least I can do. My parents send their regards as well,” said Aiden generously.</p>  <p id = > When Martha turned around to see Philip sitting on the sofa in the living room, she felt annoyed and barked at him, “Can’t you see there’s a guest? Why aren’t you preparing tea? Such poor sight!” This rubbish of a son-in-law should take a look at Aiden. The man had brought gifts while he came empty-handed and had even brought over extra baggage! How frustrating!</p>  <p id = > Philip looked at Aiden to see the latter staring at him proudly. His eyes conveyed the message, ‘Hey trash, your mother-in-law is treating an outsider like me better than she treats you.’</p>  <p id = > Philip did not make a fuss. He got up to prepare the tea.</p>  <p id = > By then, Charles had already come out of his study as he chatted enthusiastically with Aiden in the living room. Philip instead was standing in a corner, listening quietly.</p>  <p id = > “Uncle Johnston, where’s Wynn? I don’t see her.” Aiden scanned the house, squinting.</p>  <p id = > Charles yelled, “Wynnie, we have a guest in the house!”</p>  <p id = > The door of the bedroom opened. Wynn had spent a lot of effort to coax her daughter to sleep. When she saw Aiden sitting in the living room, she was mildly stunned.</p>  <p id = > “Why are you here?” Wynn’s tone was cold.</p>  <p id = > “Why can’t he be here? Should we be letting you bring home trash instead?” Martha came out of the kitchen with a plate of fruits as she glared viciously at Philip, who was standing in a corner, smoking. She looked evidently crossed. “We don’t allow smoking in the house. If you want to smoke, do it outside.”</p>  <p id = > “I’m sorry.” Philip immediately stubbed out the cigarette and opened the windows to let the smoke out. Wynn shot him a glare, wanting to drag him out this instant in case he embarrassed himself again.</p>  <p id = > “Aiden, I just bought these fruits this morning, they’re really sweet.” Martha pushed the fruit platter to Aiden like she was trying to flatter him.</p>  <p id = > “Thank you, Aunt Martha,” answered Aiden politely.</p>  <p id = > Philip felt uncomfortable when he saw this scene. When Mila was here, there wasn’t a piece of fruit in sight. She’s still your granddaughter no matter what, so why do you have to be such a snob?</p>  <p id = > “Oh, yes, Uncle Johnston, the decoration work has started for your gallery. The invitations have been sent out and the gallery will open at ten sharp on Saturday morning.” When Aiden spoke, he shot a cheeky glance at Philip as he gloated. It was clear that he held a higher position in the Johnston family than this son-in-law.</p>  <p id = > “Great, great, thank you so much, Addy.” Charles looked delighted as he imagined how grand it would be when his gallery opened. His old friends have already started to spread the word for him. A lot of aristocrats in Riverdale City have now heard that the ex-section chief of land development planning had gotten an authentic painting by Tang Bohu! And this had caused a great uproar within the city.</p>  <p id = > For suspense’s sake, they had refrained from saying which painting it was so that they could shock the guests at the coming event.</p>  <p id = > “You’re welcome, Uncle Johnston. It’s what I should be doing.” Aiden humbly added, “As for your request to meet with Mr. Clarke, I’ve already told the person in charge. You can meet him, but the time has not been set yet. You should know that a man like Mr. Clarke is quite busy.”</p>  <p id = > What the f*ck! How shameless! Philip cussed internally. Since when did he say he would meet them? This was blatantly a lie to win favors, and he had said it so tactfully. ‘They could meet, but the time has not been set yet’. Aiden was so great at pleasing Charles that the latter just kept holding him in higher regard and favored him.</p>  <p id = > “Philip, look at Aiden. You should learn from him if you have the time instead of wasting your life away. If you really can’t make it on your own, get Aiden to get you a job. You’ll look more proper that way,” Charles finally spoke on behalf of Philip’s future for the very first time.</p>  <p id = > It was a great start, but Philip felt uncomfortable listening to it. Aiden Grant’s company was worth only about a few million. It was not even enough for his allowance.</p>  <p id = > “Philip, what are you standing there for, hurry up and beg Aiden.” Martha glared hatefully at Philip. What an idiot! Her husband had already spoken up for him, but he was still just standing there. He deserved to be looked down upon!</p>  <p id = > On the other hand, Aiden sat up straight, with his eyes narrowing slightly as he waited cheekily for Philip to come and beg him. He was feeling great!</p>  <p id = > Although Wynn did not like Aiden, she felt that it was a good opportunity as well. However…</p>  <p id = > “No need. Thank you, but that company’s a little too huge, I can’t get used to working there.” Philip calmly refused.</p>  <p id = > Charles and Martha’s faces immediately darkened. Charles snorted while Martha started berating him, “Philip, how can you be so insensible? Leave this instant, our home doesn’t welcome you.”</p>  <p id = > That was an order to leave. Philip was immediately pushed out of the house by Martha.</p>  <p id = > Bam! The door closed, and Philip shook his head, smiling bitterly. He took out his phone to give Anna Carter a call. “I don’t really like this Aiden Grant.”</p>  <p id = > Anna was at the gallery, busy with decorations. When she received this call, she immediately answered, “Understood, Mr. Clarke.” She then immediately stopped the people working in the gallery and called Aiden’s number.</p>  <p id = > Aiden was currently boasting to the Johnston family when he received a call. Seeing that it was from the representative of Civil Gallery, he immediately flaunted it to Charles. “Uncle Johnston, look. It’s a call from the gallery representative.”</p>  <p id = > “Hello, Manager Carter… Has Mr. Clarke agreed to see us?” Aiden was ecstatic and pleased. He spoke loudly.</p>  <p id = > “Mr. Grant, we regret to inform you that we can’t rent the gallery to you anymore.”</p>  <p id = > “What?”</p>  <p id = > “This is Mr. Clarke’s intention. He seems to be a little upset, so the gallery will not be opened to outsiders,” said Anna coldly. Her tone was apparent.</p>  <p id = > Toot! The call was cut off and Aiden’s face froze in an instant. His expression turned ugly.</p>                <h2 id =chapter-15 > Chapter 15</h2> <p id = > Aiden, who had been looking cheery, was now in a daze. What was going on? Mr. Clarke was upset, so the gallery was not to be opened to the public. Could there be any other reason more random than this? No, he must have done something wrong.</p>  <p id = > “What’s wrong Addy, did something happen?” Charles and Martha found Aiden’s expression a little odd.</p>  <p id = > “Oh, it’s nothing, nothing at all. They’re just reporting the gallery’s situation to me.” Aiden forced out a smile then added, “Uhm, Uncle Johnston, I have some urgent matters, so I will be leaving now.” He then stood up to leave.</p>  <p id = > “Oh, Addy, is it really urgent? Won’t you be staying for dinner?” Martha followed closely behind him and saw him out the door.</p>  <p id = > “Maybe next time. Goodbye, Uncle Johnston, Aunt Martha.” Aiden hurried away. Of course, he would be in a rush. If something happened to the gallery booking, he would lose all face in front of his future father-in-law. He had to rush over to the gallery to see what was going on.</p>  <p id = > After seeing Aiden off, Martha came back inside with a smile on her face. When she saw Wynn carrying Mila, she suddenly burst out scolding, “I won’t be raising this little bastard.”</p>  <p id = > “Mom, what are you saying? Isn’t Mila still your granddaughter?” Wynn was vexed. She had been coaxing Mila to sleep in her arms. How could her mother say something like that? This was her daughter’s flesh and blood, after all.</p>  <p id = > Charles, too, felt that Martha was going overboard. He removed his reading glasses and interrupted. “That’s enough from you. Clean this up quickly and bring me the painting from Aiden. I’m going out for a spin.”</p>  <p id = > Charles was heading out to show off, of course. He wanted to let his friends take a good look. He carefully hugged the gift box, hummed a joyful tune, and went out the door. He was feeling delightful, very delightful, indeed!</p>  <p id = > ***</p>  <p id = > After he left the Johnston family house, Philip hailed a cab to Civil Gallery. Since he had already bought over the company and no longer needed to make deliveries, he now had time to go over to the gallery and take a look. He did not really plan to close it to the public. He just wanted to teach Aiden a lesson.</p>  <p id = > Upon reaching the gallery’s entrance, Philip only knew how stylish the gallery was. It was not flashy but luxurious and had a depth to it. The whole structure was designed by line patterns with monochrome as the main color. It looked extremely elegant and stylish. On both sides of the door was a small gallery paved with monochrome cobblestones, giving it a simplistic Western beauty.</p>  <p id = > Right in front of the door was a black granite sculpture. This was a piece made by the master architect who had designed and built Civil Gallery, Sirius Burton. This internationally famous architect only produced one piece of artwork every year, and thousands of people sought after his work, getting into disputes just to buy it.</p>  <p id = > Civil Gallery was Sirius Barton’s final work. Hence, to host an exhibition in this Civil Gallery would bring about great prestige and fame.</p>  <p id = > Philip stood in front of the sculpture, stared at it for a moment before mumbling to himself, “To think this is something that that old thing made. Looks normal to me.”</p>  <p id = > Philip recalled some memories. Back then, Sirius had been chasing after him, begging Philip to allow him to build something for him. Philip found his daily visits annoying, so he gave the man three hundred million to let him build Philip a mansion on top of a hill, mainly to keep his sports cars and private jet.</p>  <p id = > Oh, how I miss those beloved cars of mine. Philip exclaimed internally then headed toward the gallery entrance.</p>  <p id = > “Good day, sir. The gallery is temporarily closed to the public.” It was a young and beautiful receptionist dressed in a monochrome business skirt set with a scarf embroidered with gardenia flowers tied around her neck. She had an impressive figure.</p>  <p id = > Philip was stunned before looking inside and said, “I’m looking for someone.”</p>  <p id = > “May I know who you are looking for?” The receptionist did not treat Philip any differently just because he was in casual clothing. Instead, she had asked very politely.</p>  <p id = > “I’m looking for…” Philip was just about to answer when a tall woman walked over haughtily from within and interrupted him. She was wearing the same outfit, but the scarf on her neck was embroidered with blue enchantress hydrangeas.</p>  <p id = > “Jasmine Conner, what are you doing? Didn’t I tell we’re not open to the public today and not to let anybody in?” The woman with the cold aura got closer and swept a look at Philip as she spoke arrogantly to the receptionist.</p>  <p id = > “Sister Allison, he says he’s looking for someone.” Jasmine was apparently afraid of this woman, as she explained with a frightened expression.</p>  <p id = > Allison Cooper was the leader of the female receptionists at Civil Gallery. She was a proud person and would not hesitate to order her subordinates around. Hence, she had a hidden nickname called ‘the witch’.</p>  <p id = > Allison looked at Philip icily, sizing him up and asked suspiciously, “You’re looking for someone?” This man looked so broke wearing an over-washed T-shirt, a pair of faded jeans, and sandals. A typical get-up of migrant workers. He must be one of the construction team workers.</p>  <p id = > “That’s right. I’m looking for…” Philip smiled, revealing his pearly whites.</p>  <p id = > “Okay, okay, I got it. Follow me.” Allison abruptly interrupted Philip’s words. She turned to shoot a vicious glare at Jasmine and said, “Guard the door properly and stop letting in random strays.”</p>  <p id = > Jasmine lowered her head and bowed, apologizing profusely. She then stole a glance at Philip and smiled at him. Philip smiled back. This girl looked young but had a pleasant personality.</p>  <p id = > Without thinking much, he followed Allison inside. Philip could not help looking at Allison’s back profile. This woman had a great figure that most men could not resist.</p>  <p id = > “What are you staring at?” All of a sudden, Allison turned back with a frosty glare, staring hatefully at Philip.</p>  <p id = > “Ah, no… nothing.” Philip felt awkward. He was caught red-handed.</p>  <p id = > Allison let out a cold snort. “I’ve seen enough of you migrant workers with your snooping hands and dirty eyes. If anything goes missing in our gallery, you’ll be the first I’ll catch!” She then turned to moved forward as the disdain and contempt for the man behind grew in her heart.</p>  <p id = > Migrant worker? Philip was fuming slightly. Did she get the wrong person?</p>  <p id = > Allison led him to a construction site and started ordering him pompously, “Hurry up and get to work. Finish it before sundown. And you guys over there, don’t even think about loafing on the job. I’ll be here to supervise. If anyone slacks, your salary is gone.”</p>  <p id = > The few workers started working harder upon hearing this, terrified of their salaries being cut.</p>  <p id = > Philip was confused. They were painting this area. So, am I here to work?</p>  <p id = > “I’m sorry, are you mistaken? I’m not here to…” Philip turned to the woman beside him.</p>  <p id = > Allison narrowed her eyes and barked, “You’re not here to what? Stop with all this nonsense and start working!”</p>  <p id = > “I’m not here to work. I’m here to look for Anna Carter.” Philip was displeased with Allison’s attitude toward him. What’s with this woman’s eyes and tone. How rude! He had asked George to purchase this gallery not long ago, so he was surprised there was a snobby staff here.</p>  <p id = > “You’re looking for our manager?” Allison sized Philip up again and snickered. “You want to see our manager, with the likes of you? Why? Trying to complain to her?” What gives? This man was not even working, and he was trying to complain now.</p>  <p id = > “What?” Philip was puzzled. What was she talking about?</p>  <p id = > “I’m telling you now, and the rest of you there, listen up! Our Civil Gallery does not lack workers. There are tons of migrant workers out there fighting to work here. Don’t think that just because Manager Carter takes care of you, you can slack off. In my, Allison Cooper’s eyes, you’re all rubbish, do you understand?”</p>  <p id = > Allison then snorted. “Especially you. Who do you think you are? Even asking to see our manager. If you’re not going to work, then scram!” Allison put her left hand on her waist while her right hand pointed at the door.</p>  <p id = > Philip was outraged now. Forget being mistaken as a migrant worker. He was now even lectured by an unreasonable woman. No matter how good his temper was, it was now about to burst.</p>  <p id = > “Your name is Allison Cooper?” Philip asked darkly.</p>  <p id = > “That’s right. Why? Upset? Wanna beat me up? I can call security and throw all of you out immediately!” Allison crossed her arms and narrowed her eyes. What a bunch of garbage who doesn’t know their place. With just a little money, they’d come swarming over like dogs. Growing up, Allison’s environment had made her develop a habit of being arrogant.</p>  <p id = > “Great. I don’t think you have the right to stay in Civil Gallery.” Philip nodded, the dissatisfaction was clear in his eyes.</p>  <p id = > Upon hearing this, Allison immediately held her sides. “Hahaha! What a fool! I don’t have the right to stay here? And what, can you fire me?”</p>  <p id = > Suddenly, a crisp voice sounded from afar.</p>  <p id = > “What’s going on Allison? You’re so noisy. It’s unsightly!”</p>  <p id = > A beautiful silhouette was strutting over from a distance. She wore a white women’s suit while largely curled brown hair flowed behind her. Her fair earlobes were decorated with hoop earrings. She was overflowing with elegance.</p>  <p id = > “Manager Carter, you’re finally here. There’s someone causing trouble here.” Allison quickly jogged over, trying to flatter.</p>               <h2 id =chapter-16 > Chapter 16</h2> <p id = > “Causing trouble?” Anna frowned. Her aura became colder as the temperature around fell by a few degrees. Whoever dared to cause trouble at Civil Gallery must have eaten a bear’s heart!</p>  <p id = > When Allison saw Anna’s reaction, her mouth curved into a cruel smile. She pointed to Philip, who had his hands stuffed in his pockets as he stood leisurely, and said, “That’s right. It’s that migrant worker over there. He’s not only causing trouble but was even delusional, saying that he wants to see you. I scolded him for a bit, but he said I didn’t have the right to be at Civil Gallery. Isn’t he an idiot?”</p>  <p id = > Anna glanced coldly at Allison. Although she was not fond of Allison’s condescending tone, the girl was still one of her people, so she kept quiet. Anna then strutted elegantly over to Philip and asked with a straight face, “You’re the one causing trouble?”</p>  <p id = > Philip glanced at this woman in front of him. She’s Anna Carter? Not bad. Gorgeous and very endearing. Philip did not answer but quietly took his phone out.</p>  <p id = > Allison was furious when she saw Philip’s nonchalant expression. She pointed at him and bellowed, “Manager, look! He’s blatantly disrespecting you! I’ll call security immediately to throw him out.”</p>  <p id = > Anna nodded. She, too, was unwilling to deal with a person like this. She had just come out of her office to welcome an honored guest at the door, the new owner of Civil Gallery, Mr. Clarke! If there was any delay, she might even lose her position.</p>  <p id = > Anna had never seen the new owner. She only had his phone number. And it was only after begging President George Thomas for the longest time that he finally gave it to her.</p>  <p id = > “Allison, come with me to welcome a guest. Our new owner is coming to check on the work progress.” Anna turned over to Allison.</p>  <p id = > Allison nodded before jogging off to call for security.</p>  <p id = > Just then, a melodious ringtone rang across the room. Everyone was stunned. Anna quickly took out her phone from her pocket. The caller ID showed that it was from Mr. Clarke!</p>  <p id = > “Hello, Mr. Clarke. Have you reached? I’ll be out immediately to receive you.” Anna’s tone instantly changed from ice-cold to sweet and respectful.</p>  <p id = > Yet, the voice from the other end sounded displeased. “Look behind you.”</p>  <p id = > Look behind? Anna was stunned and immediately turned around. Only about seven workers were painting the walls behind her. Oh, there was another young man with a frosty expression holding a phone.</p>  <p id = > Wait! Anna felt like a bolt from the blue struck her! It was him! He was the new owner!</p>  <p id = > Without another word, she ran over to Philip and bowed ninety degrees in apology. “Mr. Clarke, I’m so sorry. I was too blind to recognize you. Please forgive my recklessness.”</p>  <p id = > “Anna Carter,” said Philip coldly. “I’m not very satisfied with you.”</p>  <p id = > Anna’s legs were trembling in fright, and her palms were covered in sweat. “Mr. Clarke, please forgive me. I didn’t know you would be here early.” Anna straightened her back, but was still bowing slightly. She looked terrified. This was the new owner! A prominent figure who held the world in his hands.</p>  <p id = > Riverdale City’s wealthiest George Thomas had had to come here personally to buy the gallery from the previous owner. It should be noted that the previous owner was a vicious man in the city, the underground emperor who was influential in both the legal and the underground world, Theo Zander!</p>  <p id = > Who was Theo Zander? Not a single person in Riverdale City did not know of him! Born as a ruffian, he had climbed his way up, step by step, to the throne of the underground world! Both the legal world and the mafias feared this man. There was nothing he cannot do in Riverdale City with just a few words.</p>  <p id = > Hence, after serving Theo for so many years, Anna’s social standing had risen as she got to meet more powerful figures. Her ambitions, too, grew more prominent. It was precisely because of this that she can understand that seemingly ordinary Mr. Clarke in front of her was the real deal! Because when Theo saw George, he became like a little chick before an eagle and humbled himself to a great extent, while George had only said a few sentences back then. ‘Whatever my young master requested is not to be publicized. Keep a low profile!’</p>  <p id = > The young master of the city’s wealthiest man! Just what kind of person would he be? It was just too frightening! It was after that meeting that Anna knew she had to take great care of this Mr. Clarke. If possible, she would be willing to dedicate her chastity that she had protected over twenty years to this man! All for the words that Theo had once told her after he was drunk one day. ‘I, Theo Zander, have only managed to reach this spot today, all thanks to President George’s support! However, President George is only here to keep his young master company and kill time. He had founded a company and became the wealthiest man in the city.’</p>  <p id = > It was frightening! Just too frightening!</p>  <p id = > Philip calmly glanced at Anna, then shook his head. “Forget it. Let this be a lesson learned.”</p>  <p id = > At that moment, Allison just happened to return with two security personnel. She walked over with a sneer and pointed at Philip. “That’s him, throw him out! And while you’re at it, search him to see if he has stolen anything from our gallery. With that sneaky look in his eyes, he must be a thief!”</p>  <p id = > Philip’s gaze went cold as his eyes narrowed. He let out a cold snort and said to the woman beside him, “Deal with it.”</p>  <p id = > Anna’s body straightened up. With glaring eyes, she walked over to Allison in her high heels and lifted her hand!</p>  <p id = > Slap! The crisp sound of a slap resonated throughout the whole room!</p>  <p id = > “The nerve of you! Who dares to throw Mr. Clarke out?” Anna glared furiously at Allison, threatening to tear her apart.</p>  <p id = > Allison held a hand to her immediately swelling cheek, asking incredulously, “Manager, why did you hit me? I didn’t throw Mr. Clarke out.” Allison was infuriated. She was fuming from receiving a slap from her manager for no apparent reason. Hence, she directed her anger to Philip and yelled, “What are you guys standing there for? Throw this trash out this instant!”</p>  <p id = > As soon as she finished talking. Slap! It was another smack.</p>  <p id = > Allison was not dumbstruck. Both her hands covered her cheeks.</p>  <p id = > “Allison Cooper, you’re fired! Get lost immediately!” Anna bellowed as she pointed to the door. She would not let this idiot drag herself down with her.</p>  <p id = > “Manager, why are you hitting me? What did I do wrong? You’re the one who asked me to chase him out. And what rights do you have to fire me? I’ll have you know that my boyfriend is the operations director here!” Allison was furious. She had despised Anna for a very long time now. This woman was always hanging around her boyfriend. There was a time when they went to a hotel. Her boyfriend even called out this woman’s name! How vexing!</p>  <p id = > “What rights? With my rights as the manager here!” said Anna coldly.</p>  <p id = > “Shit! Anna Carter, don’t get too cocky. My boyfriend is a director here, so don’t think you can just do as you please. I’m going now to get my boyfriend to complain to the owner about you!” Allison stomped her foot in fury and turned to walk away. B*tch! I’m going to get my boyfriend now, and you’ll be screwed!</p>  <p id = > Anna shook her head and smiled bitterly. Get the owner? The owner was right in front of you, but you could not tell.</p>  <p id = > After that, Anna turned to stand respectfully beside Philip. “Mr. Clarke, please follow me.”</p>  <p id = > Philip grunted a response and followed Anna to the lounge room in the innermost area of the gallery.</p>  <p id = > The lounge room was gorgeous. There was an open yard with a small pond and a fake mountain. There was even a small bamboo forest. It was like a world of its own. Not just anyone could enter this lounge room.</p>  <p id = > Anna had taken off her coat, leaving only her black undershirt. She sat on her knees in front of the tea set as her fair hands skillfully prepared the tea. She had first washed the tea leaves, steeped the tea, then poured it. Everything was done smoothly.</p>  <p id = > She then took the cup in her hands and, with gentle steps, walked over to Philip, who was studying some paintings on the wall. “Mr. Clarke, please have some tea.”</p>  <p id = > Philip took the cup, had a sip, and complimented, “Manager Carter’s tea-making skills are superb. This must be a Maojian Green Tea. It has a sweet aftertaste and is delicate.”</p>  <p id = > “Mr. Clarke, you’re too kind. I didn’t know that Mr. Clarke is well-versed in tea as well.” Anna smiled.</p>  <p id = > “No, I’ve just drunk too much, so my mouth is a little picky.” Philip waved his hand.</p>  <p id = > Anna was stunned. How much would a person have to have consumed to become this knowledgeable about taste…?</p>  <p id = > “How did you deal with Aiden Grant?” asked Philip.</p>  <p id = > “He has called me quite a few times, but I’ve declined them all. I think he must be very anxious now,” Anna answered.</p>  <p id = > “Okay. Ignore him a little longer. When the time comes, just do as you see fit,” said Philip before getting up. “If there’s nothing else, I’ll be leaving then. Don’t publicize the incident today. I don’t like to be disturbed.”</p>  <p id = > Anna nodded. “I understand, Mr. Clarke. President George has instructed us accordingly.”</p>  <p id = > Just then, the glass door of the lounge was pushed open. It was Allison who had left furiously earlier following behind a middle-aged man who was balding and had a fat belly. Allison was crossing her arms with a proud look. The aggrieved expression she had had earlier completely disappeared from her face.</p>  <p id = > “Anna Cooper, what are you trying to do? What rights do you have to fire Allison?” The fat man roared as soon as they entered. He then plopped down on the pure white couch, took up the cup of tea Philip had taken a sip from, and scolded, “What kind of trash is this? It’s so bitter!”</p>                <h2 id =chapter-17 > Chapter 17</h2> <p id = > “Lloyd Zalman, who allowed you to come in here?” Anna denounced icily. She despised this shitty fat man because he had been coveting her for a long time now.</p>  <p id = > Whenever he had time, Lloyd would come into her office and shamelessly tried to take her to a dinner date. He was also underhanded, always trying to bring his friends and family members into Civil Gallery through his connection. For example, Allison Cooper was one of the people he had brought in.</p>  <p id = > “Anna Carter, what’s with your attitude? As the operations director of Civil Gallery, can’t I come here to take a rest?” Lloyd Zalman settled himself comfortably into the sofa. Like a huge pile of meat, he had layers of fats on his stomach that his shirt was threatening to burst open.</p>  <p id = > “This is not somewhere you can enter. Leave immediately,” Anna pointed to the door and said coldly. The new owner was right here, but this idiot was so presumptuous.</p>  <p id = > Lloyd chuckled then glanced at Philip and teased shamelessly, “You’re really something, Anna. I never thought you would be this lonely.”</p>  <p id = > Anna frowned. “Lloyd Zalman, what did you just say?!” This b*stard knows no shame!</p>  <p id = > “I don’t want to waste time on chitchat. Allison is under me. You can’t fire her,” Lloyd said blatantly.</p>  <p id = > Allison standing nearby swept a mocking glance at Anna and Philip, feeling contempt for them. Anna, you’re such a wh*re, even bringing this wild man into the lounge area. What a b*tch!</p>  <p id = > “Haha,” Anna chuckled. “Lloyd Zalman, don’t forget that I’m the manager here. I have that right!”</p>  <p id = > “Carter! Don’t get too cocky. Brother Lloyd’s not afraid of you!” Allison crossed her arms with a condescending look on her face. “You’re already going against the rules by bringing this migrant worker in here of your own accord. If this gets out, I don’t think you can keep your manager position.” Allison then sat down beside Lloyd and leaned into each other’s arms, ignoring the other occupants in the room.</p>  <p id = > “Anna Carter, think of it properly. It’s not worth offending me for a migrant worker.” Lloyd smiled menacingly as his heated gaze locked onto Anna, wanting to devour this woman alive. He had desired this woman for the longest time, but she was an ice queen, constantly ignoring him. What a b*tch! She usually acted so cold and honorable but was really a wh*re underneath. If Allison never came to him today, he would have never known that Anna brought a migrant worker into the lounge. At this thought, Lloyd hated Philip even more!</p>  <p id = > “What do you want then?” asked Anna with a straight face. She had been observing Philip’s expression and realized that the man was indifferent. She knew that Philip did not want to get involved in this.</p>  <p id = > Lloyd licked his lips, staring at Anna with greedy eyes. “It’s simple, have dinner with me tonight.”</p>  <p id = > “What did you say?!” Allison burst out immediately, glaring at Lloyd darkly.</p>  <p id = > Lloyd quickly explained, “I’m just joking, baby. What do you suggest?”</p>  <p id = > Allison arrogantly pointed at Philip and said with a cold snort, “I want him to kneel and apologize to me!” Allison knew that it was impossible to get Anna to apologize to her, so she would humiliate the person Anna had brought in instead. She could tell that Philip was Anna’s lover.</p>  <p id = > Philip was stunned. He could not avoid getting caught in the crossfire after all.</p>  <p id = > Anna was shocked as well. She glared furiously at Allison. “Allison Cooper, you have no right to speak here, shut up!”</p>  <p id = > “Manager Carter, I’m already doing you a favor not asking you to apologize. He’s just a bum, why do you have to shield him? Or is he really your boy toy? Although his looks are only average,” Allison mocked.</p>  <p id = > “Shut up! Do you have any idea who he is?” Anna raged.</p>  <p id = > “Could he by our new boss?” Allison snorted. What did Anna mean by that? What special identity could this guy have?</p>  <p id = > Suddenly, Philip smiled faintly and asked, “Are you sure you want me to kneel and apologize?”</p>  <p id = > “That’s right! Kneel, and apologize right now!” Allison looked proud. Her whole body was emitting an air of arrogance.</p>  <p id = > “Not just kneel, you have to crawl over and prostrate,” Lloyd added in contempt. He was too lazy to deal with people himself, so he often used his authority to pressure others instead. And it worked every time.</p>  <p id = > “Your name is Lloyd Zalman, the operations director here?” In contrast to Lloyd, Philip did not seem angered. He had instead asked with a smile.</p>  <p id = > “That’s right. I’m the operations director here. Are you feeling afraid now? Apologize to my girlfriend this instant!” Lloyd crossed his legs and looked smug.</p>  <p id = > Yet, Philip suddenly turned to Anna with a frosty expression. “Fire both of them and check if he was involved in any corruption or had abused his power. I hope to see this taken care of immediately.”</p>  <p id = > Anna respectfully nodded. “Understood, Mr. Clarke.”</p>  <p id = > Upon hearing this, Lloyd cackled. He asked in contempt, “What did you just say, brat? Do you want me fired, and investigate me? Are you a fool? Do you know where this is? Do you know who I am?” He dished out a chain of questions. Lloyd held his face in his hands as he continued to laugh like he had just heard the joke of the century.</p>  <p id = > Allison, too, snickered. “Shit! What an idiot! Did he hit his head on the door?”</p>  <p id = > Lloyd and Allison had never seen such a fool. Did this man think he was the owner of this place? Hilarious!</p>  <p id = > However, in an instant, Anna flashed a cold smile and called the security department. “Send some people over and inform the financial investigation division to hand over all the evidence of Lloyd Zalman’s corruption cases and abuse of power to the police.”</p>  <p id = > In regards to Lloyd Zalman, Anna had already taken action a long time ago. She had collected a lot of evidence. It was just that they had never interfered with each other at work, so Anna had let him be. However, she would not do that today because he had offended the new boss. And that was a death penalty! An ugly death at that!</p>  <p id = > Immediately after she spoke, Lloyd’s laughter stopped. His face went dark and asked, “Anna Carter, what do you mean by this? Are you really trying to provoke me?”</p>  <p id = > Anna kept quiet.</p>  <p id = > A few security personnel rushed into the room in less than two minutes and seized both Lloyd Zalman and Allison Cooper.</p>  <p id = > “Don’t you know who I am? Unhand me!” Lloyd roared as he struggled.</p>  <p id = > However, the security guards ignored him. They were all under Anna and would only listen to her.</p>  <p id = > By now, Allison was still ignorant of her own mistakes. She yelled out loud, “Brother Lloyd, they’re all crazy! Fire all of them!”</p>  <p id = > At that moment, Philip was sitting calmly on the sofa while Anna brought over a piece of document that she had just printed. “Boss, this is their termination notice.”</p>  <p id = > Philip nodded and calmly replied, “Put it up at the door.”</p>  <p id = > Lloyd and Allison were dumbstruck. Boss? Did Anna just call him ‘boss’? The two people finally started to break out in cold sweat.</p>  <p id = > Thud! Without an ounce of hesitation, Lloyd fell to his knees and crawled over to Philip. He hugged his leg and cried, “Boss, Boss! I’m sorry, I was wrong! I was too blind to recognize you early. I’m at fault!” Lloyd started slapping his face.</p>  <p id = > Allison’s knees felt weak. Her whole body shivered, and she fell to the ground, paralyzed with fear as she sat. He’s… the boss? Impossible!</p>  <p id = > Just then, the people from the finance division led the police into the room and handcuffed Lloyd without a single word.</p>  <p id = > “Boss! Please forgive me! I won’t do it again!” The last of Lloyd’s yell of struggle resonated in the room as he was dragged away.</p>  <p id = > Now, only Allison was left, still paralyzed on the floor.</p>  <p id = > Philip shot her a cold glance then got up to leave. Anna followed closely behind him, wanting to see him out.</p>  <p id = > Thud! Allison threw herself at Philip, hugging his leg as she begged in tears. “Boss, I know my mistakes now. Please forgive me this time.”</p>  <p id = > Philip did not even spare her a glance, only said coldly, “Her position shall be replaced by that girl at the entrance, Jasmine Cooper.”</p>  <p id = > “Understood, Mr. Clarke,” replied Anna, and she quickly got security to drag Allison away.</p>  <p id = > After they left the lounge, Anna accompanied Philip, chattering happily as they made their way to the lobby.</p>  <p id = > Then, an unexpected encounter happened.</p>  <p id = > “Philip, why are you here?”</p>  <p id = > This voice sounded familiar. Philip turned to look at the side door to notice Aiden staring at him in confusion. The man’s eyes were also sparkling with hate.</p>            <h2 id =chapter-18 > Chapter 18</h2> <p id = > Philip smiled. “I’m here to take a look.” What a coincidence to run into Aiden here.</p>  <p id = > “Take a look? What’s there for you to see?” Aiden sounded displeased. “Do you know where this is? Is this a place someone like you can enter? Get out this instant!”</p>  <p id = > Aiden hated Philip. The broke man had stolen his goddess from him, and now, he even came to Civil Gallery for a stroll. Did this man not realize that he was tainting this gallery with his existence?</p>  <p id = > Philip frowned slightly, feeling irked. “Why can’t I be here to look?”</p>  <p id = > This Aiden Grant had no idea that the man standing in front of him was the new owner of Civil Gallery, so he still had the gall to look down on him. Philip felt disgusted.</p>  <p id = > “Hahaha!” Aiden laughed out incredulously. “Philip, you’re such a fool. Do you know what kind of people are allowed in Civil Gallery?”</p>  <p id = > “This, I really don’t know,” Philip calmly answered.</p>  <p id = > Aiden tipped his chin up, already forgotten what he came here to do. When else would he humiliate Philip if not now?</p>  <p id = > “The people who are allowed here are all prominent figures of Riverdale City. Their net worth starts from at least ten million.” Aiden cocked an eyebrow and mocked, “Trash like you at the lowest level of society don’t even have the right to stand at the entrance, do you understand?</p>  <p id = > “I don’t even know why Wynn would marry you. I feel sorry for her.”</p>  <p id = > Ruthless mockery and words of contempt. In Aiden’s eyes, Philip was only a tiny ant while he was an elephant. He could easily squash him dead.</p>  <p id = > “Oh, is that so? Is there a rule like that?” All of a sudden, Philip turned to ask Anna who had been standing beside him.</p>  <p id = > Aiden then finally noticed the beautiful and endearing woman next to Philip. This is… the manager of Civil Gallery, Anna Carter!</p>  <p id = > Aiden immediately put on a smile, wanting to shake her hand.</p>  <p id = > However, Anna shot him a look of disdain before answering Philip, “There isn’t.” This Aiden Grant really had guts. He had been begging to meet Mr. Clarke, but he did not know that Mr. Clarke was now standing directly in front of him. He had even mocked him!</p>  <p id = > Aiden was stunned and confused. “Manager Carter, what do you mean there isn’t? Doesn’t this rule exist since the founding of the gallery?”</p>  <p id = > The previous owner, Theo Zander, had set this rule for Civil Gallery. No one in Riverdale City dared to oppose it.</p>  <p id = > “Oh, it’s non-existent now,” answered Anna coldly.</p>  <p id = > Bullsh*t! Aiden was dumbstruck. What was going on today? The great manager of Civil Gallery, Anna Carter, was speaking up for penniless trash.</p>  <p id = > “Manager Carter, you…” Aiden did not know what else to say. He glared at Philip with envy and hate. “What are you still standing here for? Beat it!” He loathed Philip.</p>  <p id = > Anna frowned hard. The way Aiden was scolding her boss irritated her. However, it seemed that Mr. Clarke wanted this settled quietly, so Anna spoke up, sounding annoyed, “Mr. Grant, your attitude is very displeasing. Mr. Clarke has specifically told us not to discriminate people, so the rules of Civil Gallery have changed.”</p>  <p id = > “Right, right, Mr. Clarke is absolutely right.” Aiden, who had been so arrogant just a second earlier, was now nodding like an obedient child. Although he was more successful than Anna, in terms of fame, he still lost to her. She was a follower of Theo Zander! And the manager of Civil Gallery! Civil Gallery itself was already enough to make someone show respect.</p>  <p id = > However, Anna’s next words were like lightning bolts striking down on Aiden. His face turned an uncomfortable green. “But I find Mr. Grant’s attitude earlier dissatisfactory. Our Civil Gallery will never rent out our space to people who look down on others, so please leave,” said Anna.</p>  <p id = > Aiden flared up upon hearing this. He had come to plead today, but he ended up digging his own grave. At the same time, his hostility for Philip grew! It was this poor man’s fault that he could not control himself.</p>  <p id = > Aiden shot a vicious glare at Philip, who seemed to stifle a smile then humbled himself to say, “Manager Carter, I think we can still negotiate.”</p>  <p id = > Anna kept quiet like she was in deep thought.</p>  <p id = > Aiden was so anxious like he was standing on needles. “Manager Carter, how about this. I’ll do anything you ask of me. I only hope that the exhibition on Saturday can proceed as planned. Please help me, Manager Carter, to put in a few good words with Mr. Clarke.”</p>  <p id = > Anna feigned consideration then nodded.</p>  <p id = > This made Aiden happy.</p>  <p id = > “Alright. If Mr. Grant can do the following task, I will promise to allow the exhibition on Saturday.” A cunning glint flashed in Anna’s eyes.</p>  <p id = > “Please tell me. I can definitely do it,” said Aiden anxiously.</p>  <p id = > “Apologize to him.” Anna pointed at Philip.</p>  <p id = > Aiden’s eyes immediately widened, and he shrieked, “Apologize to him? Manager Carter, are you kidding? That’s a delivery man!” How could I ever apologize to the likes of him?</p>  <p id = > “Occupations are not divided into classes. Are you saying you can’t do it, Mr. Grant?” Anna gave a cold smile.</p>  <p id = > “I…” Aiden hesitated. His face was scrunching up.</p>  <p id = > Philip was instead stifling a smile as he pretended to refuse. “I… don’t think that’ll be necessary. He’s the president of a company after all. Why should he apologize to a poor man like me?”</p>  <p id = > Aiden was gritting his teeth in anger at this. So, you do realize that you’re a poor man!</p>  <p id = > “That won’t do! Mr. Grant has to apologize to you today! Mr. Clarke has instructed us that Civil Gallery is never to allow the vulgar individuals who look down on people into the premise,” Anna said sternly. She did not look like she was acting at all.</p>  <p id = > Aiden was now nervous. Cold sweat covered his forehead as he kept quiet the whole time.</p>  <p id = > “Since Mr. Grant doesn’t plan to apologize, I won’t force you. Please leave, Mr. Grant,” said Anna harshly.</p>  <p id = > Aiden immediately said, “No, no, I’m willing to.”</p>  <p id = > Then, feeling extremely conflicted, he turned to look at Philip and hastily said, “I’m sorry.”</p>  <p id = > “What? I didn’t hear it.” Philip shrugged. There was something wrong with his apologizing attitude. Failed!</p>  <p id = > “Philip!” Aiden was gritting his teeth, looking furious. “Don’t get too cocky!”</p>  <p id = > “Manager Carter, this…” Philip turned his head, pretending to look aggrieved.</p>  <p id = > Anna snorted.</p>  <p id = > Aiden immediately started trembling. He clenched down hard on his teeth and said out loud, “I’m sorry!”</p>  <p id = > “It’s not sincere.” Philip shook his head.</p>  <p id = > “You!” Aiden tried his hardest to suppress his emotions. His fists were clenched tight. This piece of trash is getting really cocky under someone else’s power.</p>  <p id = > “Mr. Grant, since this is so hard for you, I think we can just forget about it,” Anna spoke up at just the right time. Her gaze was cold.</p>  <p id = > Aiden’s heart dropped to his stomach. He knew that offending Anna meant offending Mr. Clarke of Civil Gallery. It also meant offending the underground emperor, Theo Zander.</p>  <p id = > After giving it a lot of thought, he finally bowed and said earnestly to Philip, “I’m sorry.”</p>  <p id = > Philip waved and said generously, “It’s nothing. You’ve worked hard, Mr. Grant.”</p>  <p id = > With that, Anna finally nodded. “Well done. Your sincerity is quite admirable, Mr. Grant. I think we can have our discussion now.”</p>  <p id = > Philip felt better now. He then left Civil Gallery under the watch of the people around.</p>  <p id = > When Philip left, Aiden shot a hateful and suspicious look at Philip’s back. He felt extremely annoyed. Did the man know Anna Carter? But it was impossible!</p>  <p id = > Half an hour later, after a round of negotiation, the exhibition would be held as planned. Aiden left the gallery with heavy thoughts.</p>  <p id = > As soon as he left the gates and got into his Benz, he made a call. “Do another detailed investigation of this Philip Clarke. The faster, the better!”</p>  <p id = > At the same time, shocking news spread across Riverdale City! Turner’s Hospital of Golden City will be opening a branch hospital at Riverdale City!</p>  <p id = > Turner’s Hospital was famous within the country, and the president, Henry Turner, was internationally prestigious for his medical skills. He had personally cured many prominent figures from both within and outside of the country. Professor Turner could be said to have God’s healing hands!</p>  <p id = > When this news came out, all medical-related companies and hospitals of all sizes rushed over to the temporary office Turner’s Hospital had set up in Riverdale City to ask for collaborations. Needless to say, the entrance of that temporary office was almost torn down in less than half a day.</p>  <p id = > At Beacon Pharmaceuticals, President Derrick Hall had given the order to secure the collaboration deal with Turner’s Hospital. For this reason, managers of all departments successively visited the temporary office but ended up being rejected. Not only Beacon Pharmaceuticals, but all the companies that went over were also all rejected.</p>  <p id = > Inside the conference room, Derrick sat at the head of the table, looking at his staff, who seemed to be in terrible shape. “We have to secure the collaboration with Turner’s! This will be a great opportunity for our company! I do not wish to see this opportunity snatched away by our competitors.”</p>  <p id = > “President Hall, our legs are almost coming off, but we can’t even meet the representative at Turner’s.”</p>  <p id = > “Yeah! They’re just too arrogant. I’ve seen more than ten companies going over, but they all came out disappointed.”</p>  <p id = > “I think they’re just trying to keep us hanging so they can maximize their profits.”</p>  <p id = > Seeing the crowd dispirited, Derrick slapped the table and bellowed, “It’s only been half a day, and you’re all giving up? I don’t care even if your legs come off and your mouths tear. You guys have to secure this collaboration!”</p>  <p id = > Everyone was quiet. The task was just too hard. Turner’s Hospital of Golden City was a famous hospital within the country. The hospital was a grand existence, just like a great king!</p>  <p id = > “We have to decide on a representative from our company to meet with Turner’s representative,” said Derrick. “I know this task is grave, so I hope that one of you can volunteer.”</p>  <p id = > Everyone exchanged glanced but said nothing.</p>  <p id = > Just then, Gavin gave Rose who was sitting beside him a look, and the latter immediately understood. “Mr. President, I think it would be most suitable for Deputy Manager Johnston to represent our company,” Rose suddenly suggested.</p>  <p id = > After her suggestion, people started endorsing her idea.</p>  <p id = > “Yeah, Deputy Manager Johnston is good-looking and has great verbal skills. She would be a great choice.”</p>  <p id = > “And Deputy Manager Johnston is the goddess of fortune in our marketing department. She was the one who secured the deal with Victory Pharmaceutical, so I think she can make it this time as well.”</p>  <p id = > “What’s more, Deputy Manager Johnston really needs this opportunity. Doesn’t she have a daughter that needs help? I think we should let Deputy Manager Johnston go.”</p>  <p id = > Wynn avoided eye contact. She knew this deal was too important, and she did not have any confidence.</p>  <p id = > She was just about to refuse when Derrick said, “Alright then. Since everyone recommends Deputy Manager Johnston, then we’ll have her represent our company to strive for this deal.”</p>  <p id = > Wynn had no other choice but to brace herself and agree to the task.</p>  <p id = > Upon seeing Wynn’s agreement, Gavin, who was sitting diagonally opposite her, could not conceal the smirk on his face.</p>  <p id = > After the meeting adjourned, Gavin went into Wynn’s office, saying to the troubled woman, “Deputy Manager Johnston, you have to give it your all for this deal with Turner’s Hospital. As far as I know, this collaboration involves a thirty million contract. If you manage to secure it, you will have one million dollars as commission! You won’t have to worry about your daughter’s medical expenses then.”</p>  <p id = > One million dollars. Daughter’s medical expenses. Wynn’s heart wavered.</p>  <p id = > Gavin did not stay any longer but left immediately after saying that.</p>  <p id = > Late at night, in some club. Gavin had two sexy ladies in his arms as he sat with a middle-aged man in his forties opposite him. Jeffrey Scott was the representative sent by Turner’s Hospital to Riverdale.</p>  <p id = > “Uncle, what do you think of this woman?” Gavin asked with a smile.</p>  <p id = > The man across stared at the photo in his hand for the longest time before reluctantly putting it down. He flashed a dirty smile. “Wynn Johnston, what a fine woman.”</p>  <p id = > Gavin’s forehead relaxed almost instantly. They were both men, so he knew what his uncle was thinking of. Wynn Johnston was a beauty and had a great figure. He had had his eyes on her for a very long time.</p>  <p id = > “Uncle, this woman has a useless husband and a daughter with a heart disease. She’s in dire need of money. This deal will be her lifesaver.” Gavin smiled coldly.</p>  <p id = > “Great job, you rascal!” Jeffrey teased. “Once I’ve had my fill, you’ll get yours. I know you’re interested in her.”</p>  <p id = > Gavin licked his lips.</p>                 <h2 id =chapter-19 > Chapter 19</h2> <p id = > Today was Saturday. Wynn got up very early to start putting on makeup in the bathroom.</p>  <p id = > Philip came out from the bedroom to coax his daughter, who was making a fuss. “Isn’t it your off-day today? Why did you wake up so early?” Philip was carrying his daughter as he stood at the bathroom door and asked.</p>  <p id = > Wynn answered without looking at him. “I have to go back to the office today and meet a client in the afternoon.” She then looked at herself, left and right in the mirror. She put on her lipstick, then pursed her lips.</p>  <p id = > This woman was gorgeous. Even with light makeup, she was still as endearing as a fairy.</p>  <p id = > Wynn squeezed past Philip, hastily took her bag and put on her high heels. “Oh, right. Go over to the gallery today to help my dad out. Let Lynn look after Mila. I’ve already informed her last night. She will be over at about ten.”</p>  <p id = > “Come back earlier, Mama.” Little Mila was still in Philip’s arms as she waved at Wynn with her adorable and fair little arm. Dimples appeared on her tiny cheeks as she smiled innocently.</p>  <p id = > Wynn had been rushing about, getting ready to leave. When she heard that gentle word ‘Mama’, she kissed Mila on the cheeks before reluctantly leaving.</p>  <p id = > Before she went, she reminded Philip, “Don’t forget to help my dad out.”</p>  <p id = > Philip replied, “Got it. Come back soon.”</p>  <p id = > Standing at the door of their tiny seventy square foot house, Philip watched Wynn leave. Philip lovingly patted Mila’s tiny head then said, “Play with Papa.”</p>  <p id = > “Okay, Papa! I want to ride a horsie.” Little Mila waved happily.</p>  <p id = > This little house was Philip and Wynn’s nest. The renovations were simple because they did not have a lot of money back then. Philip had taken the money to start a business. Although the business failed, they still had a house, a home. But this home was now in danger of being torn apart.</p>  <p id = > After staying with Mila for about two hours, the doorbell rang. The door opened to reveal Lynn standing there haughtily in thick makeup. She shoved Philip aside as she went in. The girl was wearing extremely short leather pants and a black lace top.</p>  <p id = > Isn’t this a little too much? Do young girls dress this sexy nowadays?</p>  <p id = > Without waiting for Philip to speak, Lynn had already gone inside and plopped down on the sofa. She first glared at Mila, who was playing with her toys at one side, then she glared resentfully at Philip. “I’ll only stay for two hours. I’ve made plans with my classmates for the afternoon.”</p>  <p id = > Philip smiled sheepishly and took out the snacks he had prepared like he was coaxing his great grandmother. “I’ll be back really soon.” Philip then walked over to Mila, who looked a little scared. He squatted down to pat her head and smiled. “Mila, Papa is going out. You stay with Aunty and be a good girl, okay?”</p>  <p id = > Little Mila nodded, catching a quick glimpse at Lynn, who was watching TV while eating chips. The little girl then took tiny steps to hand the toy in her hand to Lynn, saying in a babyish voice, “Aunty, this is for you to play.”</p>  <p id = > Lynn shot her a scornful glare without taking the toy then said coldly, “Play by yourself.”</p>  <p id = > A little while later, Philip went out. Only Lynn and Mila were left inside the house. The two girls, one an adult, the other a child, did not connect in any way. Lynn kept complaining to her boyfriend about having to take care of a brat through a video call. When Mila ran around the house, Lynn would yell at her. When Mila wanted a drink of water, Lynn had Mila get it herself. When Mila broke the glass, Lynn got up and kicked her, yelling, “Little b*tch! Your dad’s trash, and so are you! You can’t even get a glass of water!”</p>  <p id = > Mila started crying out of grievance. When Lynn saw her cry, she got more agitated. She went over and slapped Mila a few times on her tiny face, scolding viciously, “If you keep crying, I’ll sell you off! B*tch!”</p>  <p id = > Mila pursed her lips. Her aggrieved eyes were filled with tears while her tiny cheeks were swelling red. She mumbled, “Papa, I want Papa.”</p>  <p id = > Lynn was tired of listening to her and locked Mila alone inside her room.</p>  <p id = > Poor Mila patted the door and cried, “I want Papa, I want Mama… wuuuu…” After half an hour of crying, little Mila was tired and fell asleep on the bed.</p>  <p id = > Lynn was enjoying herself with her video call in the living room. “I don’t think I can make it today. There is an annoying little bastard that needs taking care of.”</p>  <p id = > “You can’t. We’re all waiting for you here. Bring the brat over. It’ll be fine.” On the other end of the screen was Jacob in a karaoke room.</p>  <p id = > “Alright, I’ll be there soon.” Lynn happily ended the video call. She opened the bedroom door and barbarically woke Mila up. Staring down at the little girl with narrowed eyes, Lynn said, “B*tch, you’re coming with me outside to play. But I’m warning you, if you make a fuss, I’ll sell you off!”</p>  <p id = > Little Mila meekly nodded in fear.</p>  <p id = > Five minutes later, Lynn took Mila and left.</p>  <p id = > Back to Wynn who had left early this morning. She had first gone back to the office because last night, Gavin told her that he had gotten some info on the collaboration with Turner’s.</p>  <p id = > A little while after she reached her office, Gavin came in with a bright smile and sat on the sofa, looking composed. “Deputy Manager Johnston, I’ll let you in on a piece of good news. The representative that Turner has sent is actually my uncle.” Gavin could not conceal the smile on his face.</p>  <p id = > Wynn looked delighted at this. “Manager Zach, are you serious? This is great! Manager Zach, you have to help me with this negotiation.”</p>  <p id = > “No problem. As long as Deputy Manager Johnston knows what to do, I will definitely help you,” Gavin said smilingly and patted the seat beside him, hinting Wynn to sit next to him.</p>  <p id = > Wynn frowned slightly but sat down. This was, after all, a thirty million dollar contract with one million commission. She would be able to pay for Mila’s surgery fees.</p>  <p id = > “Manager Zach, tell me what I should do.” Wynn smiled. She was wearing a white business suit today.</p>  <p id = > He smiled. “I’ve made an appointment with my uncle to meet at Celestial Club. We’ll talk over there later.”</p>  <p id = > Wynn pushed Gavin’s hand away and said, sounding troubled, “Manager Zach, isn’t that a little inappropriate? Let’s talk in the office.”</p>  <p id = > Gavin’s face immediately darkened. He said in a threatening tone, “Deputy Manager Johnston, you should know that even though the representative is my uncle, we might not be able to secure the deal. So many other companies have their eyes on this huge slice of cake. But if Deputy Manager Johnston is not sincere about collaborating, then I have nothing else to say.” Gavin then got up to leave.</p>  <p id = > At this, Wynn got anxious and quickly said, “Manager Zach, wait. I’ll give it some thought.” One million dollar commission! Mila’s surgery fees! Wynn comforted herself that way. She thought that she only needed to drink and sing a little. They might not do anything out of line.</p>  <p id = > Gavin’s eyes narrowed as his smile deepened. He pointed to the box on her desk and said, “Think carefully. That’s my gift for you. Once you’ve made up your mind, wear it and come with me.”</p>  <p id = > Wear it? Once Gavin left, Wynn fearfully opened the box. It was a set of clothes! Wynn felt her knees go weak. Her pupils contracted, and she clenched her fists in fury!</p>  <p id = > Just then, she received a text message from Gavin: Deputy Manager Johnston, this is a gift from my uncle. You have to wear it. If you do, I guarantee you that this deal will be yours! Oh, and I forgot to tell you. If this collaboration fails, you might be relieved from your deputy manager position. Think carefully.</p>  <p id = > After sending the message, Gavin was laughing brutally inside his office. The pure and untainted goddess of the company! Bullsh*t!</p>  <p id = > When Wynn finished reading the message, she felt her body go weak. She was so helpless and enraged. Bastard, they’re all bastards!</p>  <p id = > Not long after Gavin returned to his office, Rose barged in fuming. “Gavin Zach, what is the meaning of this? Why are you helping that witch, Wynn Johnston?!” Rose asked angrily.</p>  <p id = > Gavin beckoned Rose with a huge smile. The latter went over nonetheless and was pulled into his arms. “My dear Rose, you are my woman, so how could I be helping another woman? Relax, I’m only helping my uncle with this.”</p>  <p id = > Rose coquettishly swatted his hand away and asked with a straight face, “What do you mean?”</p>  <p id = > Gavin told Rose the whole plan, only concealing the part where he would get his share.</p>  <p id = > After hearing it, Rose’s eyes sparkled. She asked excitedly, “Doesn’t that mean that your uncle will…?”</p>  <p id = > “Ahem, it’s not too much for a woman to contribute to secure a deal.” Gavin smiled. Thinking that he could spend the night with Wynn made him ecstatic.</p>  <p id = > “What’s more, I will have to be the one to secure the deal with Turner’s anyway. Wynn is only a present for my uncle.” Gavin let out a cold laugh.</p>  <p id = > Poor Wynn was completely being toyed in the palm of his hands.</p>  <p id = > Rose nodded and smiled darkly. “This is karma! Karma! We should have done this earlier to that witch!” At the thought of Wynn’s misfortune, Rose felt an indescribable pleasure in her heart.</p>  <p id = > “Manager Zach, would it be troublesome if Wynn’s husband found out about this?” Rose was worried.</p>  <p id = > “He’s just a piece of trash, what’s there to be afraid of?” Gavin could not care less. “If he really comes to look for trouble, I can deal with him.”</p>  <p id = > Philip? Hah! A wretched piece of trash! Gavin could not wait to see the angered look on Philip’s face if he found out how his wife was being treated. Hahaha!</p>  <p id = > Rose nodded. She hugged Gavin’s neck and said, sweetly, “Then… Manager Zach, when that witch gets fired, the deputy manager’s position…” Rose had been coveting for the deputy manager’s position for a long time now. Or else, she never would have bent over backward to become this greasy and balding fat man’s lover.</p>  <p id = > “Hahaha, don’t worry. That deputy manager’s position is definitely yours!”</p>      <h2 id =chapter-20 > Chapter 20</h2> <p id = > At the same time, Philip had reached Civil Gallery. Today was his father-in-law’s exhibition, so he had come to help out.</p>  <p id = > As soon as he entered the door, Philip noticed that the hall had been luxuriously decorated. There was quality and taste. It was definitely not done simply. It seemed that Anna had put in a lot of effort.</p>  <p id = > Jasmine then noticed Philip, who was looking around at the door. She walked over with a smile and greeted, “Hello, do you need my help with anything? Uhm, you are…”</p>  <p id = > The exhibition today was extremely important. Manager Carter had instructed that everything had to be perfect as the guests today were all prominent figures in Riverdale City. Hence, all the staff had to be respectful and humble. They should never judge a person by their looks.</p>  <p id = > Jasmine had thought that Philip was a guest here for the exhibition. After all, she had already received a few, and they were now waiting at the resting area in the next hall. But to her surprise, it was him.</p>  <p id = > Philip looked up and smiled faintly. “Hello, we meet again. I’m looking for Charles Johnston.”</p>  <p id = > “Mr. Johnston?” Jasmine asked curiously before she put on a smile. Bowing slightly, she said, “Follow me, please.”</p>  <p id = > Philip nodded. This young lady was not bad, after all. She was very sincere.</p>  <p id = > However, they had only taken a few steps when a mocking voice called out from behind.</p>  <p id = > “Yo, you’re here, Philip?” Aiden was leading a few people into the gallery, looking very smug.</p>  <p id = > Philip turned around and answered with a smile, “I just got here.”</p>  <p id = > Aiden walked over. He was dressed in an expensive navy blue suit, looking very handsome and emitting a domineering aura. He reached out to pat Philip on his shoulder and insulted him, “You shouldn’t be here today. It’s just a disgrace. The guests here at the exhibition are all prominent figures of Riverdale City. Wouldn’t a useless son-in-law like you just put Uncle Johnston to shame?”</p>  <p id = > This Philip still had the guts to show up. It’s like he can’t gauge his own worth.</p>  <p id = > Philip frowned. He had no intention to respond to Aiden and turned to leave.</p>  <p id = > Seeing this, Aiden flared up. This rubbish actually dares to be this arrogant! Can’t you see that I’m talking to you? What’s with your attitude?</p>  <p id = > “Mr. Grant, your friend seems to be looking down on you.” The few people behind Aiden teased.</p>  <p id = > “Philip, stand there!” Aiden was furious. When he recalled what happened yesterday, he got even more annoyed. He rushed over, clamped down on Philip’s shoulder, and said viciously, “A trash like you has no place inside Civil Gallery. Get out this instant!”</p> <p id = > “Shit! Is this Philip Clarke, the one you said who gave out a counterfeit painting?”</p>  <p id = > “He looks really broke. With this poor getup, he looks like a farmer.”</p>  <p id = > “A defect like this is actually Wynn Johnston’s husband? What a pity.”</p>  <p id = > The few friends Aiden had brought over started insulting Philip. At this, Aiden finally felt a little better. Look at you, Philip, you’re such a disgrace. Wynn has lost all face just by being with trash like you.</p>  <p id = > Philip frowned. His expression was a little dark. “I’m here to help.”</p>  <p id = > “Help?” Aiden laughed out loud. “How hilarious! Is there a need for wretched trash like you to help out here? Can’t you see where this place is? Or what? Are you here to deliver food boxes to the prominent figures?” Aiden was now exposing his occupation to humiliate him.</p>  <p id = > “Mr. Grant, he’s a delivery man? You didn’t tell us!”</p>  <p id = > “No wonder he smells like sewers.”</p>  <p id = > “Chase this person out immediately. Don’t let him taint the air inside.”</p>  <p id = > The few people ridiculed without holding back.</p>  <p id = > Philip frowned hard. He glared icily at Aiden and said, “Occupations are not divided by class. I don’t think making deliveries is dirty.”</p>  <p id = > These people are real snobs. What’s wrong with making deliveries? Is it shameful? How many white-collared workers do you think waits for us, delivery men, to bring food over? Do you think I got arrogant from it? This won’t do. I need to change everyone’s views on delivery men. I need to spare some time to switch out the vehicles for everyone in the company. Scooters definitely won’t work, but Harley’s, maybe.</p>  <p id = > Seeing Philip’s frowning expression, Aiden laughed coldly. He patted Philip’s shoulder heavily and said, “Trash will be trash. They will never be presentable.” He then turned to Jasmine while pointing at Philip and said, “Why are you letting trash like him inside? Isn’t it just an insult to Civil Gallery? Hurry and chase him out.”</p>  <p id = > Jasmine’s expression darkened. “I’m sorry, Mr. Grant. Our manager has instructed that everyone who comes here are guests. Please forgive me for being unable to comply.”</p>  <p id = > Unable to comply? Fine, fine, fine!</p>  <p id = > Aiden swung his hand away. After shooting Philip a vicious glare, he led his friends away. He was in a rush to flatter and boast in front of Uncle Johnston.</p>  <p id = > After Aiden left, Philip courteously said to Jasmine, “Thank you.”</p>  <p id = > “There’s no need to. Let me take you to the resting area.” Jasmine smiled. Her slender body turned, and she walked ahead.</p>  <p id = > Philip studied her back profile. Although this young lady could not compare to Wynn, she was still gorgeous. She was sincere and polite to people as well. She was a nice girl.</p>  <p id = > Back to Wynn. She was in the washroom, staring at her reflection in the mirror. Beside her hand was the box Gavin had given her while inside. It was a humiliating dress.</p>  <p id = > “Huuu…” She heaved a heavy breath. Wynn mumbled to her reflection, “For Mila, I can do this for this home.”</p>  <p id = > This pitiful and foolish woman unwillingly changed into the humiliating outfit Gavin had given her.</p>  <p id = > Fifteen minutes later, Wynn put on a trench coat, left the company building, and directly got into the Benz waiting at the entrance. Just in case, Wynn had typed out a message to Philip. She then carefully placed her phone in her bag.</p>  <p id = > Gavin was sitting in the back seat. When he saw Wynn walking over in sensual steps, his mouth cracked into a hideous and lustful smile. Hahaha! Wynn Johnston, you wore it, after all.</p>  <p id = > The door closed, and the car immediately took off for Celestial Club.</p>  <p id = > In a private room, 888, of Celestial Club. Gavin pushed the door open, leading Wynn inside and called out, “Uncle, look! This is our Deputy Manager Johnston, Wynn Johnston.”</p>  <p id = > Wynn followed Gavin in. The room was huge, dimly lit with colorful lights. Sitting on the sofa was a man in his forties with sexy ladies in both arms as he smoked a cigar.</p>  <p id = > Jeffrey courteously stood up to welcome her. “I’ve heard of Deputy Manager Johnston before. After meeting today, I can see that you’re a real beauty. Come, come, have a seat.”</p>  <p id = > “Mr. Scott, you’re too kind.” Wynn took a seat and shook Jeffrey’s hand. This dirty old man was still longingly holding onto Wynn’s hand with no intention of releasing her.</p>  <p id = > Jeffrey squinted as he scanned Wynn over and over again.</p>  <p id = > Wynn tugged her hand back awkwardly and gave a small smile. “Mr. Scott…”</p>  <p id = > Jeffrey noticed that he was forgetting his manners and quickly let go. He sat down with a smile. “Deputy Manager Johnston is just too enchanting. Come, come, this is a French wine I’ve brought over, Remy Martin. I’m sure Deputy Manager Johnston will love it,” said Jeffery with a smile and a cigar in his mouth. He poured a full glass for Wynn.</p>  <p id = > However, Wynn did not take it. She refused to. “Mr. Scott, I can’t drink.” She then tugged on her trench coat to cover her legs because Jeffrey had been staring.</p>  <p id = > Seeing Wynn hesitating, Gavin sitting nearby, said with a cold laugh, “Deputy Manager Johnston, my uncle has personally poured you wine. Isn’t it inappropriate if you don’t drink?”</p>  <p id = > Jeffrey put the glass down on the coffee table and leaned back, saying coldly, “Deputy Manager Johnston, are you looking down on me? If that’s the case, we don’t need to talk about the collaboration anymore.”</p>  <p id = > A blatant threat. Just moments through the door and already, he was showing his true colors.</p>  <p id = > After Wynn pondered, she quickly took up the glass and said, “Please don’t get upset, Mr. Scott. I’ll drink.” Then, with a frown, she drank the whole glass of Remy Martin in one go. This was all for Mila, for her family.</p>  <p id = > “Mr. Scott, here, this should do it, right?” Wynn wiped the corners of her mouth and gestured to the empty glass.</p>  <p id = > Jeffrey clapped, smiling to his eyes. “Deputy Manager Johnston has great alcohol tolerance.”</p>  <p id = > For the next half an hour, Wynn was continuously forced to drink by Jeffrey and Gavin until she felt her head spin and fell to the sofa, mumbling drunken words.</p>  <p id = > Gavin and Jeffrey exchanged glances. The latter immediately got up and walked to Wynn, flashing a dirty smile. “Deputy Manager Johnston… Deputy Manager Johnston, why don’t we play something else…” Jeffrey impatiently reached out to remove Wynn’s coat.</p>  <p id = > “What are you doing!” In her drunken state, Wynn saw doubles and abruptly shrunk away in fright. She grabbed her coat tight and yelled out helplessly, scared. “Don’t come closer. I… I’m going back…” Wynn dragged her heavy body and staggered to get up. She ran to the door but…</p>  <p id = > The door would not open. At that moment, Wynn cried out to the heavens and earth, but no avail.</p>  <p id = > Behind her, Jeffrey was now acting like a pervert as he hugged her. He buried his face into her hair like a creep and took a deep sniff. “Deputy Manager Johnston, you can’t run. If you serve me well, the collaboration will go well.” Jeffrey gave her a dirty smile.</p>  <p id = > Wynn’s whole body froze. After a struggle, she shoved Jeffrey away and slapped him. She grabbed her bag and dug out a fruit knife, powerless and helpless as she leaned against the wall, enduring the splitting pain in her head. “Don’t you come any closer, don’t come closer…”</p>  <p id = > Jeffrey licked his lips. The pain in his cheek induce his urge to conquer, and he bellowed, “Stupid b*tch! Stop acting pure!” Jeffrey rushed over and snatched the fruit knife from Wynn’s hand. He then grabbed her hair and gave a vicious slap.</p>  <p id = > Slap! Wynn winced as the back of her head hit the wall. She fell powerlessly to the floor, feeling dizzy. Gavin, who was sitting nearby, was watching everything with a cold smile.</p>  <p id = > Jeffrey went over and grabbed Wynn’s ankle, laughing out lecherously.</p>  <p id = > Wynn yelled out weakly, “Help, help…”</p>  <p id = > At that moment, she only thought of Philip!</p>  <p id = > Struggling with her life, she fumbled in her bag and pressed on the send button with all her might.</p>  <p id = > ‘Swosh!’</p>  <p id = > Grabbing onto Wynn’s ankles, Jeffrey dragged her to a sofa beside. Gavin, too, stood up, and the two men with malicious expressions laughed lecherously as they looked at Wynn, who was out cold with blood trickling down her forehead.</p>  <p id = > At the same time, in Civil Gallery, Philip was about to enter the lounge when his phone rang. Feeling confused, he opened the message to see it was from Wynn. The content was simple but made his eyes widen, and pupils dilate.</p>  <p id = > ‘Philip, Celestial Club, save me!’</p>  <p id = > Just the five words almost made Philip go insane! Shit! Wynn… Wynn’s in trouble!</p>                 <h2 id =chapter-21 > Chapter 21</h2> <p id = > At Celestial Club! Why would Wynn go to such a place? Wasn’t she meeting a client? Philip did not have time to think. He dashed out of the gallery, his heart flaring up like a ball of flame. Please be safe. Please be!</p>  <p id = > Jasmine did not know what was going on but saw Philip running away in a hurry. Where was this guy hurrying off to?</p>  <p id = > Upon exiting Civil Gallery, Philip was about to hail a cab when a flashy red Porsche 911 stopped in front of him.</p>  <p id = > Anna appeared in a black trench coat. “Mr. Clarke, where are you rushing off to?”</p>  <p id = > Anna looked sideways, about to get out of the car when Philip pulled open the passenger seat and ordered in a hurry. “To Celestial Club!”</p>  <p id = > Anna did not ask more. She quickly started up the Porsche, like a red arrow being shot, the dust flew up into the air as the vehicle disappeared from Civil Gallery’s entrance.</p>  <p id = > This scene was coincidentally seen by Aiden, who was looking from the door. With hate in his eyes, he stared at the disappearing headlights, confused. Why is Philip with Anna? He’s just a piece of wretched trash. Shit! Could he be having an affair! Great! A frightening chill flashed in his eyes. He will tell Wynn about this, and the two of them would divorce! I’m just so brilliant!</p>  <p id = > In less than five minutes, Anna had brought Philip to the entrance of Celestial Club in her Porsche 911. This drew on a lot of attention from passersby.</p>  <p id = > Celestial Club was a famous entertainment club within the city. It was a mixture of good and evil inside—both the legal world and the underground mobs. The owner was Riverdale’s famous, Drogo Hanks, widely known as ‘Brother Drogo’. Although he was not as renowned as Theo, he was still a prestigious man.</p>  <p id = > Drogo and Theo never interfered with each other’s business, and they both had their own business turfs.</p>  <p id = > Philip got out of the car.</p>  <p id = > The entrance of Celestial Club was not only occupied by beauties in tight dresses, but there were also two large men whose arms were more massive than their thighs. It was easy to tell that they were bouncers. They emitted a cold and frightening aura.</p>  <p id = > “Hey kid, where are you from? Can’t you see that we’re on break? Who are you to rush in? Beat it!” Seeing Philip about to dash in, a muscular man stretched out a hand to block him. His expression was fierce.</p>  <p id = > As he spoke, he narrowed his eyes arrogantly at Philip, completely full of himself. Of course, this man also judged a book by its cover. If it were a prominent figure instead, he would have bowed and greeted with friendly eyes.</p>  <p id = > But unfortunately, it was Philip. This brat was only staple goods, so very ordinary. He was not worth respect.</p>  <p id = > Pressuring people with their authority had always been their forte. They would first show off their strength and let the troublemakers know that Celestial Club was not a place to cause a scene, and this would save them the hassle later. But it was clear that the bouncer did not know Philip’s identity. Hence, he was playing with fire.</p>  <p id = > Philip looked up slightly with cold eyes. “Make way!”</p>  <p id = > “F*ck! You’re pretty cocky, aren’t you? Asking me to make way?” The muscle man raged. He was staring at Philip with fire in his eyes as he blocked the way with his solid body. With just one arm, he could hold Philip up.</p>  <p id = > “That’s enough! Who allowed you to speak to Mr. Clarke that way?” Suddenly, Anna’s voice rang from the side. She had just parked the car away when she saw Philip in trouble. She immediately ran over in a panic.</p>  <p id = > When the two muscular men saw Anna walking over with an icy expression, they were stunned! In their line of work, no one could not recognize Anna Carter. She was Theo Zander’s confidante and his only confidante! A woman! Among the underground forces, she was a woman of status.</p>  <p id = > In an instant, the two muscular men put aside their arrogance.</p>     <h2 id =chapter-22 > Chapter 22</h2> <p id = > “Sister Anna, why are you here?” The bouncer who had been arrogant earlier was now meek as a child. They were working for Celestial Club, so these men had been used to flaunting their authority. But meeting Anna still made them feel uneasy because if they were not careful enough, they might end up offending Theo.</p>  <p id = > “Hmph!” Anna snorted. After a few more words of reproach, she did not waste any more time with them. She could see the restlessness in Philip’s eyes, so she quickly let Philip inside after forcing the two men to back down.</p>  <p id = > The bouncers scratched their heads in fear and confusion as they watched Philip and Anna go in.</p>  <p id = > “Hey, who do you think that guy is that Sister Anna would personally escort and protect?”</p>  <p id = > “Don’t be so nosy, unless you feel like separating your head from your body.”</p>  <p id = > The interior design of Celestial Club was indeed luxurious. Gold was the primary color of the interior with dragons and phoenix as the central theme. The place looked extravagant. Even the front desk was made from Calacatta marble, worth a king’s ransom! However, to Philip, these were all rubbish.</p>  <p id = > Anna and Philip had just entered the lobby when a stunning woman came over. She was wearing red pumps while her voice sounded like a melodious string instrument. “Hey, Sister Anna, what brings you here today?”</p>  <p id = > This woman with a vintage appearance was the manager of Celestial Club, Jade Quinley. Everyone called her ‘Sister Jade’. She gave off a vampish and mature vibe.</p>  <p id = > Jade’s status in Celestial Club was quite similar to Anna’s status in Civil Gallery. She was the confidant of Drogo and his lover. However, her influence was only limited to within the club. Once outside the club doors, Anna’s status could overpower Jade’s by a mile. Hence, it was publicly known that Jade disliked Anna. These two women were destined to be rivals.</p>  <p id = > “Jade Quinley, enough with the nonsense. Where is Miss Johnston?” Anna could not get used to the coy look in Jade’s eyes.</p>  <p id = > “Sister Anna, you must be joking with me. There isn’t any Miss Johnston on my premises. Only men come here, not women. What’s more, isn’t it a little inappropriate for Sister Anna to just barge in like this?” Jade cocked an eyebrow, waving her Victorian hand fan with an arm crossed below her chest. Her contempt for Anna was evident in her tone.</p>  <p id = > Philip had no time to waste in a pointless argument. He asked coldly, “I’ll only ask once, where is she?”</p>  <p id = > Jade finally noticed the man standing behind Anna. “Wow, Sister Anna, isn’t this little boy toy of yours too ignorant? Is there any place for him to speak up here?”</p>  <p id = > Slap! The crisp sound of a slap resonated in the air.</p>  <p id = > Jade held a hand to her face, feeling incredulous. She yelled out in fury, “Ann Carter! How dare you slap me? You’re only Theo’s dog, what right do you have to lay a hand on me? Don’t you have any respect for our Celestial Club?”</p>  <p id = > “That’s right,” Anna replied icily. This woman had the nerve to call Mr. Clarke ignorant! One slap is already kind enough of me! Celestial Club? Haha, sorry, but to me, this place is trash! And in Mr. Clarke’s eyes, this place is lower than trash!</p>  <p id = > Philip frowned hard, already losing his patience. “I don’t care what you think this place is or who supports you in the dark. I’m warning you, don’t provoke me or I’ll flatten this whole place! Spill! Which room is Wynn Johnston in?” Philip was furious. The consequences would be dire. If this woman did not know what was good for her, Philip did not mind laying this building to waste.</p>  <p id = > Jade was initially stunned but then quickly laughed and pointed at Anna. “Anna Carter, this boy toy of yours sounds more arrogant than you. Flatten my club? No one has dared to say something like that in a long time. You’re the first.”</p>  <p id = > Anna smiled coldly. She was not at all worried about Philip’s declaration. She knew that Mr. Clarke would do just as he said. Even if he tore half of the city apart, Anna would not be surprised, much less this club.</p>  <p id = > Anna faintly added, looking indifferent. “Jade Quinley, I don’t want to waste time with you. Lead the way now. Even a second’s delay is not something you can afford to compensate for!”</p>  <p id = > Seeing Anna be this forceful, a flicker of annoyance flashed in Jade’s eyes. “Are you trying to scare me, Carter? Don’t think that just because you’re under Theo that I would be afraid of you. I’m telling you, the guest at Celestial Club today is not someone you can provoke. Even if Theo himself is here today, he would have to play by the rules! And you two want to take that woman away? Dream on!”</p>  <p id = > “So, you won’t lead the way?” Anna’s eyes were ice-cold. She looked extremely aggravated. This Jade Quinley was just asking for trouble.</p>  <p id = > “Heh! I’ll be honest with you Carter, the guest inside is a big-shot from Golden City. As for that Miss Johnston, she sure is a great beauty, very enticing. It’s her honor to be able to serve that guest. Perhaps, by now she’s already…” Jade did not continue but the smug look on her face was apparent that she was provoking them.</p>  <p id = > Anna’s scalp felt prickly. She stole a glance at the man next to her.</p>  <p id = > Philip looked calm but the fury behind his eyes made Anna shiver. Even Jade could now sense the change in Philip.</p>  <p id = > Philip’s expression was dark as night, and his voice was ice-cold. “Don’t challenge my patience. Take me there now or I’ll make sure you live the rest of your life in pain and regret!”</p>   <h2 id =chapter-23 > Chapter 23</h2> <p id = > Philip’s expression was cold, his tone chilling. With his stern appearance, his body was exuding a strong murderous intent!</p>  <p id = > Jade was stunned. She backed away a few steps by instinct. This… this brat had a more powerful aura than Brother Drogo! And it was not just a little bit. It was so heavy that she found it hard to breathe. Just who exactly was he?</p>  <p id = > Quickly steadying herself, Jade’s eyes turned cold as a smirk appeared on her face. “Sister Anna, this brat of yours is just arrogant on a whole new level. Doesn’t he know that this is Brother Drogo’s turf?”</p>  <p id = > Anna smiled instead. Drogo Hank? So what? Mr. Clarke can lay this Celestial Club to waste with just one sentence. Even if Drogo were here today, once he knows of Philip’s identity, he would have to prostrate and ask for Mr. Clarke’s forgiveness.</p>  <p id = > “Jade Quinley, I’m warning you, if you don’t want to get yourself in any trouble, lead the way now! Or else, even Jesus can’t save you!” Anna, too, was running out of patience because she could distinctly feel the cold aura from Philip getting denser.</p>  <p id = > Anna, who was known for her elegance and mature personality, strutted over to the wine rack, grabbed a bottle of wine, and smashed it at one of the gang member’s heads who was here to look after the club.</p>  <p id = > Blood immediately splattered everywhere! The guy held his head that was dripping with blood as he howled on the floor.</p>  <p id = > “Anna Carter, you’ve crossed the line! This place belongs to Hanks, not Zander!” Jade’s expression changed as she flared up.</p>  <p id = > “I’ll ask you one more time, where is the room?” Anna pointed the broken bottle at Jade. The sharp edges of the glass were directly in front of Jade’s fair and delicate face.</p>  <p id = > This frightened Jade. She had never seen Anna this irritated. This was Brother Drogo’s turf, so her actions were blatantly provoking a feud between Theo Zander and Drogo Hanks!</p>  <p id = > “Sister Jade!” In an instant, a group of gang members who were here to look after the club rushed out, surrounding both Philip and Anna. They all held something in their hands, ready to attack both of them. Each member had a vicious look in their eyes, wanting to tear both Anna and Philip apart this instant. The situation was dangerous as the temperature in the atmosphere plummeted.</p>  <p id = > However, Philip, who was being surrounded by gangsters, remained indifferent. There was no fear in his expression, and his deep-set eyes were filled with blazing fire.</p>  <p id = > Anna, who had been following Theo for eight years, had seen too much of these situations. She could not be any calmer. “What’s wrong? Are you trying to prove that I, Anna Carter, can’t win against numbers? Or have you all forgotten Brother Theo’s words?”</p>  <p id = > Jade froze at this. Her expression was mingled with fury and fear. Why?</p>  <p id = > Ever since Theo had risen to his position, he said that whoever touched his men meant offending Theo himself. No matter who they were, Theo would have their whole families destroyed! He was that dominant and vicious! Hence, Jade and the gang members hesitated, looking conflicted.</p>  <p id = > Who exactly was this Theo Zander? He was king of the underground. Although he had kept a low profile in recent years as he focused on growing his legal business, everyone knew that he was a force to be reckoned with.</p>  <p id = > Jade realized that Anna would stop at nothing this time. Her eyes darkened, then with a wave of her hand, she ordered the gang members to disperse.</p>  <p id = > “Anna Carter, are you sure you want to go in there? I’ll say it upfront. The person inside is not someone you can mess with. Even if Brother Theo was here today, he has to show a little respect. I hope you won’t regret this!” Jade gave her a cold smile.</p>  <p id = > Anna frowned slightly. Jade’s behavior meant that there really was some trouble inside. Just who was this person that Celestial Club valued so much? Is there anyone in Riverdale City that even Brother Theo could not offend? If they were not from Riverdale, could they have come from outside the city? If they really were from an outstation, it might really be troublesome.</p>  <p id = > However, after Anna turned to look at Philip, the worries in her heart disappeared. If Brother Theo was correct, Mr. Clarke could overpower the situation.</p>  <p id = > At this thought, Anna said, sounding annoyed, “Stop with the nonsense and lead the way!”</p>  <p id = > Jade smiled coldly and said no more. Philip followed her closely while Anna tailed behind. At the same time, Anna had quietly taken her phone out to send Theo a text message.</p>  <p id = > Soon, the three of them reached the largest VIP room in the club. The majestic, large golden door looked magnificent and luxurious. But Philip did not have the heart to admire it. Right now, he was only thinking of Wynn. Please be safe!</p>    <h2 id =chapter-24 > Chapter 24</h2> <p id = > Philip lifted his leg and kicked hard at the door!</p>  <p id = > Bam! The door was burst open.</p>  <p id = > Jade was stunned. She never expected the boy toy to be this barbaric and immoral. She would definitely get Brother Drogo to take care of him later!</p>  <p id = > The loud music inside the room muted the sound of the door being kicked open. The colorful shining lights made it hard to see what was going on inside. There was a crowd of men and women, naked as they drank, played games, and fooled around.</p>  <p id = > Tap! Philip pushed the switch on the wall, and all of a sudden, the whole room was brightly lit, exposing various hideous activities. The occupants of the room shrieked as they picked up their clothes from the floor in a flurry.</p>  <p id = > Philip was dumbstruck by this scene. He quickly swept a glance around the room in search of Wynn’s presence. Where is Wynn? Where is she?!</p>  <p id = > Just then, a hostile voice rang from within the room. “Anna Carter, this isn’t Theo Zander’s turf. A b*tch like you causing a ruckus here with your boy toy means you’re blatantly disrespecting me, Drogo Hanks!”</p>  <p id = > Somewhere below the stairs, sitting on a sofa was a man with a square face, triangular eyebrows, and a beard. His expression was dark.</p>  <p id = > This man was Drogo Hanks, the owner of Celestial Club! He was also one of the five most powerful men in the underground world.</p>  <p id = > He stared darkly at Anna, completely ignoring Philip’s existence. Anna Carter was indeed a woman worthy of becoming Theo Zander’s confidant. Drogo had long wanted a taste of Anna. Men like him were fond of conquering strong women like her. It gave them a sense of thrill.</p>  <p id = > The whole room was divided into two areas. Up the stairs was another area blocked by bead curtains, and through those curtains was the silhouette of a few people.</p>  <p id = > This was not the room Wynn had initially been in. Drogo knew that he had a valuable guest today, so he came over personally to offer them the presidential suite.</p>  <p id = > Anna’s voice sounded cold as she said, “Brother Drogo, we’re here for someone. We hope you can take the initiative to hand her over.”</p>  <p id = > Just then, all of a sudden, a desolated shrill rang from behind the bead curtains. The voice sounded distinctly helpless. “Ah! No! Go away…”</p>  <p id = > Wynn! Philip flared up in an instant, looking in the direction of the voice. Behind the swaying bead curtains, two men were roughly dragging a woman as they tore the garments from her body.</p>  <p id = > “F*ck! Get your filthy hands off!”</p>  <p id = > Whoever touched the dragon’s nerve had to die!</p>  <p id = > In an instant, Philip’s eyes turned red. He roared out loud, grabbed two glass bottles, and rushed up the stairs!</p>  <p id = > Drogo barely had time to react when he saw a silhouette fly past him. How dare he make a move! I am Drogo Hanks! The man everyone has to greet whenever they see me, but this boy toy just went ahead and took action?</p>  <p id = > Before he could react, two smashing sounds resonated from behind him! Simple and rough!</p>  <p id = > Philip smashed the two bottles of wine in his hands onto the balding men’s head! The moment the bottles were smashed open, red wine mixed with blood flowed to the floor.</p>  <p id = > “Ahh!” Two shrieking voices rang throughout the whole room. Gavin and Jeffrey both instantly fell to the ground, holding their heads. Blood flowed through from in between their fingers. It was terrifying.</p>  <p id = > Philip went over to snatch the coat from the sofa and wrapped it around Wynn, whose shirt was torn to pieces. He hugged her tight in his arms and comforted her. “It’s okay, sweetheart, I’m here.”</p>  <p id = > Wynn was in a state of panic and confusion. She continued to struggle in Philip’s arms, screaming as tears poured out. Then, she bit Philip viciously on his arm.</p>  <p id = > It hurts! Philip endured the pain, hugging Wynn tightly as the fury within him threatened to burn a hole in the sky!</p>  <p id = > “Ahh! Wuuu…..” Wynn sobbed, eventually regaining her senses. She tilted her head up to look at Philip through tear-filled eyes, mumbling, “Philip…” Just after calling his name, Wynn passed out.</p>  <p id = > Anna had run over. After a look, she anxiously said, “Mr. Clarke, let’s go outside first and send Miss Johnston to the hospital.”</p>  <p id = > Philip nodded. He picked Wynn up in a bridal carry and turned, ready to leave.</p>  <p id = > Just then, Drogo came over to block their way. He growled in a low voice, “Leave? Anna Carter, what place do you think this is? You beat up my valuable guest and now you want to leave?”</p>  <p id = > Philip’s pupils contracted as his gaze turned cold.</p>  <p id = > Without waiting for him to speak up, Anna replied sternly, “Drogo Hanks, don’t think that I’m afraid of you. Would you even dare to lay a hand on me? Aren’t you afraid that Brother Theo would come for you?”</p>  <p id = > Drogo’s expression stiffened. Sure enough, he did not dare lay a hand on Anna because she was Theo’s follower. Laying a hand on her meant smacking Theo in the face. The consequences would be severe.</p>  <p id = > However, his valuable guests had been attacked right in front of his eyes. If this matter got out, Drogo would lose his standing within the city.</p>  <p id = > “F*ck! No one’s leaving today!” Jeffrey, whose head had been cracked open earlier, was now getting up shakily. His face was covered in blood and his expression was frightening as he roared, “Drogo, seize that man! I want him dead!”</p>  <p id = > Drogo hurried over and urged, “Mr. Scott, they are Theo Zander’s people.”</p>  <p id = > Jeffrey raged and bellowed, “Theo Zander? Who the hell does he think he is?”</p>  <p id = > Soon after he spoke, suddenly! Bam! The door of the room was kicked open again. A group of hitmen in black suits rushed in! In an instant, the room was filled with people.</p>  <p id = > Drogo’s expression stiffened as cold sweat rolled down from his forehead. He stared fixedly at the door of the room.</p>  <p id = > A striking silhouette, dressed in a full white suit and white shoes, wearing a white gentleman’s man and a cigar in his mouth, strode into the room before everyone’s eyes.</p>  <p id = > “Whoever lays a hand on Mr. Clarke is offending me, Theo Zander!”</p>     <h2 id =chapter-25 > Chapter 25</h2> <p id = > Theo Zander! King of the underground! A dominating figure who was famous within the city.</p>  <p id = > Drogo, who had been full of himself earlier, was now rooted to his spot with a dark expression, feeling intimidated as he watched Theo come in.</p>  <p id = > “Brother Theo, why did you bring so many people into my establishment?” Drogo’s complexion looked terrible. He quietly gritted his teeth as he felt irked. Could he go against Theo? The answer was obviously a ‘no’.</p>  <p id = > However, Theo completely ignored Drogo, never giving the latter so much as a glance. This made Drogo flare up in anger. I’m still one of the top five most powerful men in the underground world of Riverdale! This man is just too disrespectful!</p>  <p id = > What happened next was a scene that shocked every person in the room! Even if Anna was already aware of Philip’s identity, she could not help but feel waves of shock as she saw it with her own eyes.</p>  <p id = > Theo had strode over to Philip, took down his gentlemen’s hat, and then bowed to him, showing great respect and humility. “Mr. Clarke, my apologies for being late.” This young man was old George’s young master, so he shall be Theo’s young master as well.</p>  <p id = > Philip was calm, only nodding faintly. “You should know what to do.”</p>  <p id = > “Of course.” Theor straightened up and stared at Drogo with a dark glint in his eyes.</p>  <p id = > By now, Drogo was dumbstruck. He could not imagine how the underground king could be this respectful to a mere boy toy. What the f*ck was going on? But Drogo was not an idiot. In an instant, he figured that the young man must be someone of a distinctive identity!</p>  <p id = > At that moment, Theo was staring at Drogo with a dark expression.</p>  <p id = > Slap! With powerful strength, Theo landed a tight slap across Drogo’s face!</p>  <p id = > Drogo stared at Theo in disbelief. He glared back at the man with venomous eyes and said through gritted teeth, “Theo Zander, are you trying to start a fight?” There was no clamor, but a vicious look on Drogo’s face.</p>  <p id = > “Start a fight?” Theo laughed before giving the man a fierce kick in the chest. Then, with the soles of his white shoes, he stepped on Drogo’s face. “And can you win against me with the likes of you?”</p>  <p id = > As expected of the underground king, his approaches were always dominant and vicious, never showing Drogo any respect as he taught the man a lesson like Drogo was only a little brat.</p>  <p id = > Theo stared down at Drogo and said coldly, “Today, whoever offended Mr. Clarke has earned their name on my hit list. Not a single one of you can leave!”</p>  <p id = > Soon after he spoke, the men that Theo had brought over pressed all of Drogo’s men onto the ground. Devastating screams rose and fell, one after another!</p>  <p id = > Just then, a crisp interrogation sounded from behind the bead curtains. Jeffrey held his bloodied head with a napkin as he parted the bead curtains furiously and roared, “You’re Theo Zander? So what you’re saying is that you will lay a hand on me as well?” Jeffrey was seething. He was only here to toy with some woman, but he got his head cracked open instead!</p>  <p id = > Drogo, who was still on the ground, smiled darkly. “Brother Theo, don’t blame me for not reminding you that Mr. Scott is not someone you can offend. Even if you’re very influential within Riverdale, Mr. Scott is from Golden City. Before him, you’re nothing!”</p>  <p id = > Mr. Scott? From Golden City? Theo frowned slightly. His foot pressed down harder as he glanced at the man standing above the stairs.</p>  <p id = > Recognizing Theo’s confusion, Drogo quickly crawled up and ran over to Jeffrey. He quickly straightened himself up, arranged his suit, and rode on Jeffrey’s coattails, saying, “Brother Theo, this is Mr. Jeffrey Scott, the representative from Turner’s Hospital in Golden City. He’s also Professor Henry Turner’s nephew!” Drogo was almost shouting the last sentence out loud like he was afraid no one could hear him.</p>  <p id = > Thump! Theo’s pupils contracted as he looked at Jeffrey, his fury had almost dissipated by now.</p>  <p id = > That man was Professor Henry Turner’s nephew!</p>   <h2 id =chapter-26 > Chapter 26</h2> <p id = > Noticing the troubled look on his face, Philip frowned slightly and asked, “Will this be difficult for you?”</p>  <p id = > Theo walked over to Philip and whispered into his ear, “Mr. Clarke, I don’t think we can lay a hand on Jeffrey Scott.” They genuinely could not.</p>  <p id = > The main reason was that Jeffrey’s uncle, Henry Turner, was an internationally famous medical magnate and was even nicknamed as ‘the Healing Hand of God’ within the country. The patients that Professor Turner had cured with his hands were the most prominent figures worldwide. Just a few words from these figures were enough to shake up the economy in a location of their preference! Among them included a few individuals who held high authority in foreign politics within their country! For example, the governor of Riverfront Province was also one of Professor Turner’s patients. He was a powerful man that no one dared to provoke.</p>  <p id = > Needless to say, everyone had great respect for this magnate of the medical industry. Whoever provoked this tycoon was like inciting the wrath of a magnitude seven earthquake!</p>  <p id = > After his explanation, cold sweat was scarcely visible on Theo’s forehead. Complicated emotions surged behind his eyes as he looked at Drogo and the infuriated Jeffrey on top of the stairs. He started to feel nervous.</p>  <p id = > However, beyond everyone’s expectations, Philip did not seem the least fazed. He only stared coldly at Jeffrey and said, “There isn’t anyone in this world that I can’t touch.”</p>  <p id = > Theo’s whole body trembled as fire returned to his eye!</p>  <p id = > Yet, Jeffrey started laughing out of exasperation. His expression darkened as he said, “Okay, okay, you have a great imagination there, brat. But I refuse to believe that there’s a single person in this tiny city that I, Jeffrey Scott, can’t take down!”</p>  <p id = > “Drogo Hanks, I want this man crippled now! And those two women, tear their clothes off! I will f*ck them silly right in front of him!” There was a dangerous glint in Jeffrey’s eyes as he completely ignored Philip. His uncle was Professor Henry Turner, a medical magnate that could, with a stomp of his feet, make the whole Riverfront Province quake! For a boy toy to speak up so boldly, he must have a death wish!</p>  <p id = > Drogo wore a smirk on his face as he bellowed into the walkie-talkie in his hand, “All of you, get your asses in here and get to work!”</p>  <p id = > Stomp, stomp, stomp!</p>  <p id = > In an instant, a group of muscular tattooed men rushed into the room, confining everyone inside as the whole area became crowded.</p>  <p id = > “Get him! Cripple them all!” Drogo waved and roared. The devilish amusement in his eyes only grew thicker.</p>  <p id = > Theo was shocked. He led his men near and pointed at Drogo. “Drogo Hanks, I’d advise you not to make this mistake. Mr. Clarke is not someone you can afford to provoke!”</p>  <p id = > “F*ck you! Is there anyone in here that I, Jeffrey Scott, can’t afford to provoke?” Above the stairs, Jeffrey bellowed with bloodshot eyes. It was a frightening sight to see his bloodied face paired with his bloodshot eyes. “Get him now! Kill him!”</p>  <p id = > “Mr. Clarke!” Theo knew the situation had gotten dangerous. He locked on to the hitmen with metal baseball bats in their hands as they rushed toward Philip, and in an instant, a brawl broke out between them!</p>  <p id = > Theo was suited to his title as the underground king. In just a few moves, he had taken down four of the hitmen!</p>  <p id = > Drogo’s gaze turned cold at this. He narrowed his eyes and personally led eight of his men over to surround Theo. No matter how fierce Theo was, two fists were no match for eight pairs of arms. He was easily beaten to the ground.</p>  <p id = > Drogo boldly stepped on Theo’s back and laughed out madly. “Brother Theo, who knew that a day like this would happen? From today on, the whole of Riverdale City is mine to command!”</p>  <p id = > Theo gritted his teeth and glared furiously at Drogo. “Drogo Hanks, you can deal with me but you definitely can’t lay a finger on Mr. Clarke. Or else, you’ll regret it for life!”</p>  <p id = > “F*ck! You still have the nerve to threaten me!” Drogo stepped down hard, his gaze was menacing.</p>  <p id = > The atmosphere in the room was grim. Drogo’s men had overpowered Theo, Anna, and all of the people they brought over. Around the room, only Philip was left holding his fainted wife.</p>  <p id = > Jeffrey walked down the stairs, step by step. His gaze was fierce as he smirked. “Brat, weren’t you so very pompous earlier? Here’s another bottle of wine, why don’t you hit me in the head with it again!”</p>  <p id = > Philip remained composed. There was not a trace of fear in his expression. He gently put Wynn down on the sofa then sighed. “Jeffrey Scott, Drogo Hanks, both of you should have never provoked me.”</p>  <p id = > Hearing this made Jeffrey flare up in anger. He pointed at Philip and roared, “Drogo, cripple this brat! Make him kneel to speak to me!” He sat down on the sofa, unyielding, with mockery in his eyes as he smoked a cigar. A servant went over the dress the wound on his head.</p>  <p id = > Drogo held the metal bat in his hand as he closed in on Philip with a cold smile.</p>  <p id = > “Drogo, stop! You can’t lay a hand on Mr. Clarke!” Theo who was pressed onto the ground yelled out. If anything happened to the young master in this place, he, Theo Zander, would have cut his own throat to atone for his powerlessness.</p>  <p id = > Drogo only flashed a smirk and lifted the baseball bat, aiming at Philip’s knees as the latter stood tall.</p>  <p id = > All of a sudden, an ominous ringtone resonated in the room, confusing everyone.</p>  <p id = > Drogo glanced at Jeffrey. Jeffrey was feeling generous and said coldly, “Let him answer it.”</p>  <p id = > Philip frowned. He glanced at the caller ID, but it was an unknown number. He then answered the call, ignoring everyone present. “Hello, who’s this?”</p>  <p id = > “Mr. Clarke, how do you do? I am Henry Turner. I’ve already reached Riverdale City with my medical team and was wondering if it would be convenient for us to meet you.” On the other end of the call, Henry Turner’s tone was respectful and his attitude humble.</p>       <h2 id =chapter-27 > Chapter 27</h2> <p id = > Henry had just come out of the airport with a medical team formed by a group of stern and meticulous doctors as they followed behind him. If this scene was noticed by someone who knew the industry, they would definitely be shocked! The infamous medical team from Turner’s Hospital! They were not number one, but the only one!</p>  <p id = > “Henry Turner?” Philip let out a cold laugh as his gaze fell on Jeffrey. “You should ask your nephew if he would let me meet you.”</p>  <p id = > Nephew? Could it be Jeffrey?</p>  <p id = > Henry seemed to have realized in an instant and quickly answered respectfully, “Mr. Clarke, there must be some sort of misunderstanding going on. Please pass the phone to Jeffrey, I’ll talk to him.”</p>  <p id = > Philip mildly raised an eyebrow but tossed the phone to Jeffrey who was sitting on the sofa. “Your uncle’s looking for you.”</p>  <p id = > Uncle? Jeffrey burst into anger and slammed a hand onto the table. “Bullsh*t! Why would my uncle call you?”</p>  <p id = > As Jeffrey bellowed, suddenly a furious reproach sounded from the phone that was shining a white light on the sofa. “Jeffrey Scott! What are you saying? Do you mean that even I can’t hold you down now?”</p>  <p id = > Un… Uncle! It’s really Uncle’s voice! Jeffrey instantly started trembling all over in shock. Cold sweat was pouring as he quickly held the phone up. “Hello, Uncle, why are you…” He was really dumbstruck. Waves of chill seeped out of his skin from his bones. He could not believe that his uncle would actually give this boy toy a call.</p>  <p id = > Before he could finish, Henry had interrupted him furiously on the other end. “Jeffrey Scott, I don’t care how you have offended Mr. Clarke, but apologize to him this instant! Or else, you’ll be in serious trouble!”</p>  <p id = > That ice-cold tone and his words of command made it hard for Jeffrey to breathe. His uncle was furious!</p>  <p id = > “Uncle, you… why would you call this stupid brat?” Jeffrey still could not believe this as he attempted one last time.</p>  <p id = > “Hmph!” Henry, who was hastily rushing out of the airport with his medical team, entered their prearranged Audi A8 L. “What do you mean stupid brat? He’s Mr. Clarke! How dare you be so disrespectful! Kneel and beg for Mr. Clarke’s forgiveness this instant or I’ll disown you!”</p>  <p id = > Jeffrey gave up completely. His uncle was really mad with anger! How had things turned out like this? He lifted his head. The sweat on his forehead drenched his wound and the piercing pain instantly sobered him up.</p>  <p id = > He ran over quickly to humble himself and said, “I’m sorry, Mr. Clarke, I was being ignorant, I deserved to be punished! I apologize for my rashness earlier. Please forgive me!”</p>  <p id = > Jeffrey Scott, who had been acting all high and mighty earlier, was now fearfully apologizing. This made everyone freeze in shock! Was this man not Professor Turner’s nephew? A figure from Golden City? Was he not almighty? Why would he apologize? That call earlier seemed to have been from his uncle, Professor Turner. A call to the boy toy? Oh gosh! Just who was this Philip Clarke? For the medical magnate, Henry Turner, to call him personally and make his nephew fear him so.</p>  <p id = > Especially for Drogo, to see his backer that he had been relying on apologize so fearfully to a young man made him anxious! It made him frightened! Drogo’s heart trembled as sweat started pouring down like a waterfall. Just who had he provoked?</p>  <p id = > Theo and Anna had already broken free and were now standing beside Philip, glaring at Drogo with dark eyes. “Drogo, I’ve already told you that Mr. Clarke is not someone you can afford to provoke!”</p>  <p id = > Thud! Without an ounce of hesitation, Drogo immediately fell to his knees in front of everyone!</p>  <p id = > One of the top five more formidable men in the underground world just kneeled so easily before Philip. He crawled over to Philip’s toes and hit his forehead to the floor to beg for mercy. “M… Mr. Clarke, I know my faults now, please forgive me! I was blind to have offended Mr. Clarke, I deserve punishment!” As he cried out, Drogo started slapping himself. The crisp sound of his slaps resonated throughout the whole room.</p>  <p id = > Philip watched coldly. “Anna, take Wynn away.”</p>  <p id = > “Understood.” Anna led two men away as they took Wynn out of the room.</p>  <p id = > In an instant, Drogo’s men were all squatting down on the floor as they hugged their heads, shivering. This was because the first thing that Theo did after getting up was to order the people outside the room. Within moments, around fifty men had rushed into Celestial Club and this place was completely surrounded. On the outside, a group of over ten hitmen in black suits could be seen blocking off the club.</p>  <p id = > Inside the room, Philip sat on the sofa as he looked indifferently at Jeffrey who was bowing low and Drogo who was kneeling on the floor with his forehead bleeding from prostrating.</p>  <p id = > “Get over there!”</p>  <p id = > Thud! Gavin was kicked over to the front of the sofa by Theo from behind the bead curtains.</p>        <h2 id =chapter-28 > Chapter 28</h2> <p id = > His whole body was trembling as his gaze darted around.</p>  <p id = > Upon seeing Philip, he crawled over on his knees and prostrated as he begged, “Ph… Philip, Brother Philip! Seeing as I’m a colleague of Deputy Manager Johnston, please forgive me this time. I won’t ever do it again.”</p>  <p id = > Philip’s eyes were cold with underlying fury. “I do not wish to see him in Riverdale City ever again.”</p>  <p id = > “Yes, Mr. Clarke!” Theo was a man of the underground world, so he could easily understand the meaning behind Philip’s words.</p>  <p id = > With just an eye signal, two men grabbed Gavin who was wailing and howling for forgiveness and dragged him to another room. Gavin was so frightened that he wet and soiled himself on the spot, leaving a foul smell in his wake.</p>  <p id = > “It’s your turn, Jeffrey Scott,” said Philip.</p>  <p id = > Jeffrey hung his head and forced a smile. “Mr. Clarke, since my uncle is Henry Turner and you’re acquainted with him, let’s not create any bad blood. Let me go this time and I will never again step foot into Riverdale City.” Jeffrey had already thought it through. No matter how powerful Mr. Clarke was, he was probably only just a little bit more capable. If Mr. Clarke really did anything to him, his uncle would definitely not let this man off. Hence, he grew a little more confident.</p>  <p id = > “Don’t create bad blood?” Upon hearing this, Philip laughed. “Do you know who that woman you were trying to lay a hand on is?”</p>  <p id = > Jeffrey genuinely had no idea. “It’s just a woman. Does Mr. Clarke really want to turn this into a life and death struggle?”</p>  <p id = > “A life and death struggle?” Philip’s expression hardened almost immediately as his gaze turned cold. “Wynn Johnston is my wife!”</p>  <p id = > Thump! Jeffrey shuddered. He knew in an instant that things have gotten serious! He had ended up toying someone else’s wife! Sh*t!</p>  <p id = > “Uhm, Mr. Clarke, it was just an almost. I’ll compensate five hundred thousand as an apology, please take it as a mental compensation for yourselves.” Jeffrey was feeling anxious inside but he maintained a confidant front. To Jeffrey, five hundred thousand was quite a lot.</p>  <p id = > “Are you discussing money with me?” Philip said chillingly. “Theo, give him three million.”</p>  <p id = > Theo did not hesitate. He took one man along with him to personally withdraw the cash. The whole process took less than five minutes as three silver briefcases appeared on the coffee table, opened to show that it was all filled with red notes! There were three whole million in here!</p>  <p id = > Cold sweat started to form on Jeffrey’s forehead. The corner of his mouth twitched. “Mr. Clarke, what do you mean by this?”</p>  <p id = > “I’m buying your third leg!” Philip’s voice was cold.</p>  <p id = > Right after he spoke, Theo’s men pressed Jeffrey to the ground with his back on the floor, and stripped him, leaving only his underwear on.</p>  <p id = > Jeffrey was frightened and in fear.</p>  <p id = > “Mr. Clarke, my uncle is Henry Turner. You can’t do this!” Jeffrey yelled as he struggled, but it was futile. “If you lay a hand on me, my uncle definitely won’t let you off!”</p>  <p id = > Philip said nothing but closed his eyes.</p>  <p id = > Theo raised the metal bat in his hand and smashed it down on Jeffrey.</p>  <p id = > “Ah!!” A soul-shuddering scream resonated throughout the whole room. Jeffrey’s face had turned purple as huge drops of sweat fell from his forehead. His back was arched, unable to speak a word, and could only hum.</p>  <p id = > At the same time, five Audi A8 Ls stopped in front of Celestial Club. Henry got out of the car frantically with the mayor of Riverdale City behind him. Keagan Sanders was drenched in sweat as he brought along his secretary to chase after Henry. “Professor Henry, please slow down.”</p>  <p id = > The moment Keagan received word of the medical magnate, Henry’s arrival in Riverdale City, he had personally rushed over to the airport to receive the professor. For this prominent figure to visit Riverdale City was a great honor, and Keagan intended to receive him with the greatest hospitality!</p>  <p id = > However, the moment he received him, Henry had chosen to rush over to Celestial Club. Keagan was confused. Just who was it that Henry had to go over to see personally and could make him this anxious.</p>  <p id = > At the entrance of Celestial Club was a group of hitmen in black suits solemnly standing guard. They immediately stopped Henry. “I’m sorry, but this place is currently closed off.”</p>  <p id = > Henry frowned. He was about to say something when Keagan rushed over and bellowed, “Who dares to stand in the way?!”</p>  <p id = > Upon seeing the newcomer, the hitman started shivering in fear. “Ma… Mayor Sanders…”</p>  <p id = > Oh God! Why was Mayor Sanders here? Who was this old thing that Mayor Sanders had to escort personally?</p>  <p id = > In an instant, the hitmen gave way to them and bowed as they let Henry, Keagan, and the rest of their group in.</p>  <p id = > When Keagan saw that the premise was filled with people, a fire started to burn within him! It seemed like he had to hasten to rid the city of evildoers!</p>  <p id = > The door of the VIP room was pushed open. Henry rushed in to immediately see Jeffrey letting out blood-curdling screams on the floor. However, he ignored his nephew and rushed over to Philip, bowing slightly as he greeted, “Mr. Clarke, my apologies for being late.”</p>  <p id = > Keagan, who had been following closely behind, felt like his whole being had just been struck by lightning. He was shocked when he saw this scene.</p>  <p id = > Pro… Professor Henry is bowing and apologizing to a young man!</p>                <h2 id =chapter-29 > Chapter 29</h2> <p id = > Philip nodded faintly, looking indifferent as he stood up and asked, “Professor Henry, do you have any opinion on this?”</p>  <p id = > Henry glanced at Jeffrey, screaming on the floor, and then replied, “He asked for it. To have Mr. Clarke punish him for his wrongdoing is his honor.”</p>  <p id = > His nephew had just been crippled, but the man said it was an honor instead. Theo inhaled a breath of cold air. He already knew that Mr. Clarke was not a regular man, but he never anticipated him to be this powerful!</p>  <p id = > Henry Turner was the magnate of the medical world, the Healing Hand of God! He had cured so many prominent figures. The man was a living, breathing network! With just a few words from Henry, Theo could easily fall to the lowest level in society.</p>  <p id = > At that moment, Jeffrey was still on the ground, staring at his uncle as he mumbled, “Uncle… avenge me…”</p>  <p id = > Henry looked furious. Although he did not know exactly what his nephew did wrong, it must have been serious! “Director Stanley, take Jeffrey away and do your best.”</p>  <p id = > Henry then added coldly, “Inform the hospital that Jeffrey Scott has been stripped of all his titles, and from today on, he can only stay in Golden City. If he ever takes one step out of the city, you have my permission to break his legs!”</p>  <p id = > Director Stanley stepped into the room and bowed. “Understood, Mr. President.”</p>  <p id = > Jeffrey was then carried out of the room.</p>  <p id = > Keagan, who had just witnessed this whole scene with his own eyes, was standing at the door, staring heatedly at Philip. This young man must be a great figure. After waiting for a bit, Keagan held out both hands and went over with a huge smile, greeting, “Hello Mr. Clarke, my name is Keagan Sanders, the mayor of Riverdale City.” This was an opportunity!</p>  <p id = > Philip shot a hesitant look at Keagan before faintly reaching out a hand to shake his. “I’m Philip Clarke.”</p>  <p id = > By now, Theo was already too shocked for words! The mayor had come here too! And he was now standing in front of Keagan with a group of his followers in this room. It was clearly a death wish!</p>  <p id = > Keagan, too, had noticed Theo and knew that this man was of a complicated status. Hence, he had not managed to prosecute Theo thus far.</p>  <p id = > “Theo Zander, why did you bring so many people here?” Keagan interrogated. After all, he was the mayor of this city, so how could he let the underground mobs do as they please right in front of him? Although Theo had a complicated background, Keagan figured that he ought to query the man at least since they had finally met.</p>  <p id = > Theo looked aggrieved as he stared at Philip. “Mr. Clarke…” He had started as a mobster in his early days, but in recent years, Theo had gradually cleaned his hands and was now doing legal businesses. And he was one of the biggest taxpayers with barely any criminal records in his files.</p>  <p id = > Philip knew that Theo had a complicated background, so he said softly, “Mayor Sanders, Theo is one of my men. If there’s any problem, I can come with him to assist in investigations.”</p>  <p id = > Of course, they could assist in investigations. Theo’s background was now clean, and he was a locally famous entrepreneur in Riverdale City. He had even set up Theodorus Charity Organization. Theo was now considered a legal businessman. He had already taken care of all his previous dark records.</p>  <p id = > Keagan was stunned. He glanced at Henry, then bloomed into a bright smile and said, “Please don’t say that, Mr. Clarke. If that’s the case, there’s no need for the hassle.”</p>  <p id = > Philip did not say anything else but left the room with Henry as they discussed Mila’s surgery on the way.</p>  <p id = > Upon exiting Celestial Club, Philip looked at this three-story-tall building icily and said, “There’s no need for a place like this to exist anymore. Destroy it.”</p>  <p id = > Theo bowed and received the order. After one phone call, three bulldozers and forklifts made their way over. There were loud rumbling sounds!</p>  <p id = > Riverdale City’s famous Celestial Club was torn down in a day and laid to waste! This news instantly made its way to the front page of all the news channels. Someone had even snapped a photo of Philip’s back with his party, and it became the local news headlines.</p>                    <h2 id =chapter-30 > Chapter 30</h2> <p id = > Philip got into the Audi and continued discussing Mila’s condition with Henry. Henry had already researched Mila’s condition for half a month now, and the success rate he could come up with was 80%! That meant a very high chance of complete recovery!</p>  <p id = > They went to the hospital to take a look at Wynn. She was now safe but still unconscious due to the shock.</p>  <p id = > Just after Philip left the hospital entrance with Henry, Keagan, and Theo in tow, he received a call from his father-in-law.</p>  <p id = > Charles was furious as he bellowed, “Philip! Where did you run off to? Where’s the painting I told you to deliver?”</p>  <p id = > Slap! Philip smacked his forehead then remembered that he had left the house this morning to deliver a painting to Civil Gallery. How could he have forgotten it? Without another thought, Philip quickly said, “Send me to Southville Street.”</p>  <p id = > Theo immediately went up to open the door of his Benz, inviting Philip in. Henry and Keagan, too, wanted to invite Philip into their own cars, but they were not as quick as Theo.</p>  <p id = > “Let’s follow them,” said Henry.</p>  <p id = > Soon, five Audis followed closely behind the Benz as they made their way to the old housing area at Southville Street.</p>  <p id = > The car did not stop in front of the house because Martha was at home. Philip had the car stopped somewhere else then he jogged over to the old house and knocked. “Mom, I’m here for the painting.”</p>  <p id = > Martha opened the door with a sulky expression and scolded, “Where the hell did you run off to? Were you trying to get me to deliver the painting myself instead? I don’t even know what you’re doing with your life. You only know how to slack around.”</p>  <p id = > As Philip listened to Martha’s abusive words, he only smiled sheepishly and continued to apologize. He picked up the gift box that was readily placed on the coffee table then rushed out the door. Behind him, his mother-in-law continued to admonish, “Why did my daughter even marry such a wretched piece of trash! She must have been cursed by terrible luck!”</p>  <p id = > Martha’s voice could be heard around the end of the street. The mouths of Theo, Henry, and Keagan, who had been standing beside their cars, twitched. This mother-in-law was too much. But, why was Mr. Clarke tolerating her when he was so powerful in reality?</p>  <p id = > “To Civil Gallery. You guys can stop following me. If there’s anything, we’ll talk tomorrow.” Philip looked at Henry and the rest who still looked like they wanted to follow him.</p>  <p id = > After Philip got in, the car drove toward Civil Gallery.</p>  <p id = > Back at the gallery, all the decorations were ready and the place was filled with honored guests. Everything was going well except for the main hall where a crowd of people waited with dark expressions. Among them was Charles Johnston who was especially annoyed. He put his hands behind him as he said, “This Philip really can’t do anything right. He can’t even deliver a painting properly after being told to!”</p>  <p id = > The exhibition had already started, but the most significant piece, Companionship at the Spring Mountains by Tang Bohu, had not arrived yet. This flustered Charles!</p>  <p id = > It was such a rare opportunity for him to finally shine in front of his old friends and a few of the famous collectors within the country, but this scene was now made awkward by his son-in-law. How could he not be furious?</p>  <p id = > Aiden was standing beside Charles, unable to conceal the smirk on his face as he said, “Uncle Johnston, I think Philip is blatantly disrespecting you. This is such an important exhibition, but he is late. Isn’t he just trying to embarrass you?” This brat was really terrible! He was trying to make the situation worse even at a time like this.</p>  <p id = > “Hmph!” Charles snorted. “I don’t have a son-in-law like him!”</p>  <p id = > The people inside the gallery were mostly art collectors as well, and they were getting impatient as they spoke up.</p>  <p id = > “Charles, we’re all here because of your invitation, but what do you have to show us? Where’s the painting?”</p>  <p id = > “You’re insincere with us. Or maybe you don’t really have the Companionship at the Spring Mountains and are just trying to bluff us.”</p>  <p id = > “The other stuff here isn’t much, and we’re just waiting for this painting. Tell us how much longer we must wait.”</p>  <p id = > As everyone got restless, Charles could only smile and apologize. “It’ll be here soon, my son-in-law is on the way.” This sh*tty Philip! Once this exhibition ends, I will have Wynn divorce him!</p>  <p id = > “Hehe, Charles, wouldn’t asking that crap of a son-in-law of yours to deliver that painting be a disgrace to the art piece?” Among the crowd, a balding middle-aged man started mocking.</p>  <p id = > He was Charles’s rival, Benjamin Money. They were in the same department in their working days and had always been at each other’s throats.</p>  <p id = > The rumors about Charles’s son-in-law being a wretched piece of trash was already spread throughout their circle, and people would at most gossip under their breaths. But for Benjamin to put it out on the table and mock him in front of everyone was going a little too far.</p>  <p id = > Just then, Philip arrived at the outer area of Civil Gallery in Theo’s car. Once he confirmed that no one around recognized him, he got out and rushed into the gallery.</p>  <p id = > Theo, too, had waited for a bit before entering the gallery on the pretense of visiting the place as he followed Philip.</p>  <p id = > With the gift box under his arm, Philip jogged over to exhibition hall number one at Area C.</p>  <p id = > As soon as he showed up at the gallery entrance, Aiden who had sharp eyes called out, “Philip’s here!” After shouting out, he rushed over and snatched the painting from Philip’s hands and admonished, “Philip, what took you so long just to deliver a painting? You didn’t go and mess around with some woman, did you?”</p>  <p id = > Aiden had seen Philip get into Anna’s car with his own eyes, so he intentionally said this loudly.</p>          <h2 id =chapter-31 > Chapter 31</h2> <p id = > Philip frowned at Aiden. The latter glared furiously at him and smirked. “You’re even late at the simple request of delivering a painting. Aren’t you just blatantly disrespecting Uncle Johnston?”</p>  <p id = > Slap! Charles had come over with an infuriated expression and slapped Philip hard across the face. He bellowed in anger, “Why do I have such a useless son-in-law like you? You’re an embarrassment!”</p>  <p id = > This sudden slap stunned everyone inside the exhibition hall. However, there was not a trace of sympathy on these people’s faces. Instead, it was filled with mockery.</p>  <p id = > Watching Charles hit Philip in front of so many people made Aiden ecstatic. Great slap! Trash like this should get slapped more often.</p>  <p id = > A biting chill flashed in Philip’s eyes, but he quickly suppressed it. Lowering his head, Philip said, “I’m sorry, Dad. I was a little delayed on the way.”</p>  <p id = > “Hmph!” Charles let out a cold snort. He took the painting, composed his emotions, then turned around smilingly to walk away. “Come, come, here’s the authentic painting by Tang Bohu, the Companionship at the Spring Mountains.”</p>  <p id = > Aiden stood haughtily in front of the battered Philip. He straightened his suit and said cheekily, “Philip, you have great tolerance. I don’t know how garbage like you manage to marry Wynn.” Aiden could not resist provoking and mocking Philip.</p>  <p id = > Philip merely gave him a cold smile. “That has nothing to do with you.”</p>  <p id = > Aiden snorted. “Unwilling to give up? Why don’t you look in a mirror? Uncle Johnston hates you. If I put in just a little more effort, you’ll soon be kicked out of the Johnston house. By then, you’ll only be a stray dog. I want to see just where your pathetic mug will end up when that happens!” Aiden laughed out loud before casting Philip a mocking glance. He then turned around to go and cheer for Charles.</p>  <p id = > On the other hand, Theo had already followed Philip to the hall. That scene earlier made him flare up in anger as he watched. “Mr. Clarke, do you want me to teach that brat a lesson for you?” Theo came over and whispered to Philip.</p>  <p id = > Philip shook his head and frowned. “No need. This is my problem. You just have to do your duty.”</p>  <p id = > Theo became nervous and quickly nodded. If anyone else saw this, they would have definitely been shocked beyond words. The mob king, Theo Zander, to be this respectful to a plain young man and even seemed to be a little frightened by him, would stir up great news!</p>  <p id = > Philip took a deep breath then stood in the corner of the exhibition hall, doing nothing.</p>  <p id = > The other side of the gallery was crowded as Charles proudly shared his painting with his old friends and fellow collectors. That overflowing happiness on the older man’s face made Philip a little worried on the inside. Would his father-in-law really force Wynn to divorce him? Just how should he save his broken marriage?</p>  <p id = > “Charles, this painting is really great! It’s an authentic piece!”</p>  <p id = > “If you auction it away, it would be worth at least five million!”</p>  <p id = > “I don’t think so. I say it might even be worth ten million!”</p>  <p id = > The crowd was admiring the painting as they discussed out loud.</p>  <p id = > Ten million? Charles felt an indescribable shock and happiness when he heard this. Ten million for one painting!</p>  <p id = > “Addy, are you really giving me this painting?” Charles turned to ask Aiden, who was standing beside him. It was ten million after all, how could the man just give it away like that?</p>  <p id = > Aiden, of course, understood Charles’s meaning behind it. He said generously, “Uncle Johnston, this painting is naturally yours. I’m not familiar with collections, so this painting would only be worth its existence in the hands of a great collector like you.” Needless to say, Aiden really knew how to kiss up to someone.</p>  <p id = > Charles was overjoyed and patted Aiden on the shoulder with a huge smile on his face. “Come and have dinner at our house someday. I’ll get your Aunt Martha to cook you some of her best dishes.”</p>  <p id = > Charles could easily tell that Aiden had a thing for his daughter. However, Charles was a proud man. Wynn was already married to Philip, so how could he force the two of them to part and remarry his daughter to Aiden? That would mean a second marriage, and Charles would be shamed.</p>  <p id = > But perhaps he could ask his daughter’s opinion.</p>   <h2 id =chapter-32 > Chapter 32</h2> <p id = > At this thought, Charles glanced at Philip, who was standing idly in a corner. He snorted in annoyance and mumbled, “What a useless man!”</p>  <p id = > Philip noticed his father-in-law looking at him, so he gave him a bright smile, but the older man only rolled his eyes at him. Okay, so the older man really did think nothing of him.</p>  <p id = > Just then, outside of Civil Gallery, a luxurious Bentley stopped at the entrance. A few female receptionists quickly rushed over.</p>  <p id = > Russell Field had specifically come to Civil Gallery today because he heard that there would be a treasure from China’s Ming Dynasty displayed today. An authentic painting by Tang Bohu! He was very intrigued. The man was a famous collector in the country, so when he heard that there would be a rare piece on display, of course, he had to see it with his own eyes!</p>  <p id = > Soon after he stepped into the gallery, Russell’s identity caused an uproar.</p>  <p id = > “Oh god! Isn’t that President Field from Civil Trading Group?”</p>  <p id = > “The grandmaster of collectors is actually here!”</p>  <p id = > “This is too shocking. Charles’s painting has even intrigued this great man!”</p>  <p id = > Many of the aristocrats in Riverdale greeted Russell respectfully upon seeing him and started fawning over the man. Not just because he was a famous collector, the man was also president of a company and had a net worth of more than three billion dollars!</p>  <p id = > Of course, the term ‘grandmaster of collectors’ was only an exaggeration by the local folks. Russell was only just a little well-known. But within the country, he was definitely at the level of a grandmaster, no doubt!</p>  <p id = > By then, Charles had rushed out from the innermost corner of the gallery with a bright smile. There was a group of people following behind him, all of them his friends.</p>  <p id = > “Oh my, it’s an honor to have Master Russell personally visit my exhibition. Please forgive me for not going out to meet you.” Charles was very excited. For the grandmaster of collectors, Russell Field, to make a personal visit, meant that his fame was about to shoot up tremendously for the grandmaster of collectors.</p>  <p id = > “Mr. Johnston, you’re too kind. I’m just here today because I’ve heard great things. I will be imposing on you.” Russell politely shook Charles’s hand as he smiled.</p>  <p id = > “It is my honor that Master Russell could come. Let me show you around. These are just some of the pieces that I tinker with in my free time. They can’t compare to Master Russell’s collection.” For Charles, meeting Russell was like a beginner meeting a great teacher. Charles was extremely humble toward Russel.</p>  <p id = > Upon seeing Russell, Aiden wanted to get acquainted with him by all means. He went over and ardently shook the older man’s hand, saying, “President Field, how do you do? I’m Aiden Grant, the manager of Stardream Media. It’s a pleasure to meet you.”</p>  <p id = > Russell politely shook his hand and was about to say something when Aiden continued, “President Field, I was the one who set up the exhibition today, why don’t I show you around myself?”</p>  <p id = > Just after he spoke, the facial expression of Charles, who was standing behind Aiden, turned dark. Did this brat not see that he was standing there? Did anyone need him to show the man around?</p>  <p id = > However, Aiden had completely forgotten about Charles by now as he proactively started to introduce Russell around the place. Although Charles was annoyed, he still followed them and added explanations wherever he felt necessary. The group behind Charles kept nodding as they went, acting as Russell’s entourage.</p>  <p id = > Many people were mumbling on the sidelines.</p>  <p id = > “Now that Russell Field is here, Charles will surely get famous.”</p>  <p id = > “Right? Whatever Master Russell admires would at least be worth about tens of millions.”</p>  <p id = > “Although the man has a useless son-in-law, he has a rich future son-in-law.”</p>  <p id = > The crowd was gossiping quietly with envy and admiration on their faces.</p>  <p id = > Russell did not actually think much of the collection displayed in the outer gallery. In other words, they were trash. After forcing himself to take a look, he came to the most luxurious part of the exhibition hall with Aiden.</p>  <p id = > There was a painting hung behind a glass display. In front of that display stood a young man.</p>  <p id = > When Russell looked over and saw the familiar silhouette, he got excited! Mr. Clarke was here too!</p>  <p id = > Seeing Philip stand in front of the painting made Aiden flare up in anger. He walked over with a sullen face and pushed Philip away, berating him, “Get lost. Can’t you see that President Field is here? What are you standing there for? Do you even know how to admire art?” This trash was acting like a know-it-all!</p>  <p id = > Charles, too, was irked. Everyone had come out to welcome Russell, but Philip was just standing there, dazed in front of a painting. What garbage with poor sight!</p>  <p id = > Philip shot an annoyed glance at Aiden but said nothing. He quietly moved aside.</p>  <p id = > Seeing Aiden behave so rudely and unreasonable to Mr. Clarke made Russell’s blood boil in anger. He was just about to go over and admonish Aiden when he saw Philip frown at him. Russell immediately stopped in his tracks, understanding Philip’s message. President Thomas had told him before that Mr. Clarke disliked being conspicuous. However, he had to think of something to shatter this Aiden’s arrogance! Humiliating Mr. Clarke meant humiliating himself!</p>  <p id = > “Master Russell, please take a look. This is the greatest piece of this exhibition, an authentic painting by Tang Bohu, the Companionship at the Spring Mountains.” Charles immediately jumped out and introduced his greatest collection with much enthusiasm. This is too exciting! For Master Russell to see for himself personally would mean that I, Charles Johnston, will henceforth be famous within the collectors’ community!</p>  <p id = > However, after he spoke, Russell’s expression turned odd. Was this a joke? Companionship at the Spring Mountains…? As he stared at it, Russell found the painting within the display glass to be very familiar. Was this not the painting that he had kept as a treasure for so many years and then gave it to Mr. Clarke? Wait! No, this painting was a little odd.</p>     <h2 id =chapter-33 > Chapter 33</h2> <p id = > With just one look, Russell could tell that this was not the painting he gave Mr. Clarke. This was a counterfeit! So, who gave this painting to Charles? It was even displayed in Civil Gallery, and it seemed like everyone here thought it was an authentic piece.</p>  <p id = > While Russell was lost in thought, Charles started to talk about this painting ceaselessly, including an explanation of its origins. “Master Russell, this painting is a birthday gift from Addy. It’s a priceless piece. Would you like to appraise it?”</p>  <p id = > Addy? Aiden! Russell stared at Aiden, who was smiling to his eyes with an odd look. The latter seemed full of himself. This was the man who was rude to Mr. Clarke earlier!</p>  <p id = > With this, Russell now had a plan formed. Aiden, you’re dead meat! I will teach you a lesson in place of Mr. Clarke!</p>  <p id = > Russell walked over to the glass display earnestly and started examining it. Everyone felt the air become tense and mysterious as they watched on. After all, this was Master Russell, a famous collector in Riverdale City. If he, too, held this painting in high regard, it must be an authentic piece! It must be priceless!</p>  <p id = > As he stood beside Russell, Charles was like a little child, unable to conceal the pride and joy on his face. He was already beginning to imagine how his fame would rise up as a collector in Riverdale City. With this thought, he felt greater favor for Aiden and nodded at him.</p>  <p id = > Seeing Uncle Johnston this elated, Aiden was naturally cheerful. He looked at Philip who was standing in a corner and tilted his head up, looking smug.</p>  <p id = > Philip only smiled faintly then lowered his head to toy with his phone. What was he doing? He was, of course, giving Agnes a task.</p>  <p id = > ‘Agnes, check where the nearest place that sells Harley bikes is. I will buy them in a few days and switch out all our scooters with Harley bikes.’</p>  <p id = > The contents of Philip’s message were simple but crude.</p>  <p id = > At that moment, Agnes was working in the office. She was wearing a white shirt, a black skirt, and black stilettos. The skin on her legs was soft and smooth like a newborn’s. She looked bewildered as she stared at the text message then quickly replied: Boss, do you mean to say that you want to switch out all of our company’s delivery scooters with Harley bikes?</p>  <p id = > Agnes felt her head spin. For the first time, she experienced just how rich Philip was! One Harley bike cost tens of thousands, and the price increased ten folds if it was a better one. There were about a hundred people in the company, so that would amount to ten million in expenses! What exactly was Philip’s identity? To be able to be this rich…</p>  <p id = > ‘Okay. Contact them immediately, and it’s best to make an appointment. I don’t want it to be troublesome later on.’</p>  <p id = > After replying with this message, Philip put his phone away and sat quietly to watch.</p>  <p id = > Russell’s every move attracted the attention of everyone in the gallery. People were even starting to praise Charles, and that made Charles feel even more ecstatic.</p>  <p id = > “Master Russell, how is it? What would this authentic piece by Tang Bohu be worth in the market?” After Russell was done looking, Charles asked impatiently as he smiled to his eyes.</p>  <p id = > Russell pondered for a moment. Everyone grew anxious, looking at him.</p>  <p id = > “Look, even Master Russell is looking stern. This piece must be really great!”</p>  <p id = > “I bet that it’ll be worth at least eight million!”</p>  <p id = > As the crowd chattered, Russell said in a deep voice, “Mr. Johnston, this painting would be worth….”</p>  <p id = > “Hahaha!” Charles could not resist laughing out.</p>  <p id = > However, the continuation of Russell’s words made Charles’s laughter stop as the latter choked and coughed.</p>  <p id = > “A hundred dollars.” Russell’s voice resonated throughout the gallery hall.</p>  <p id = > A... a hundred dollars?!</p>  <p id = > Charles was dumbstruck, as was everyone else.</p>  <p id = > Aiden looked most bewildered. I’ve spent more than two million on this, but it’s only worth a hundred bucks? Is he joking? Is this man really THE f*cking Master Russell? He must be a fake!</p>  <p id = > “Master Russell, please don’t joke around. This is Tang Bohu’s Companionship at the Spring Mountains, an authentic piece!” Charles’s forehead was now covered in sweat as he emphasized the words ‘authentic piece’.</p>  <p id = > Russell chuckled then explained, “Then, let me tell you that this painting is a fake.”</p>           <h2 id =chapter-34 > Chapter 34</h2> <p id = > A fake! The crowd in the gallery burst into an uproar. It was actually a fake!</p>  <p id = > “Impossible! How could this be a fake? We’ve all seen it before. It’s a genuine piece.” Charles quickly explained. “Although I’m not as famous as Master Russell, I can still tell a painting’s authenticity. How could this be a fake?”</p>  <p id = > Russell knew that Charles would be in denial, so he analyzed the painting on the spot. “This painting could be said to be mistaken for the genuine piece. It’s not surprising if you guys can’t tell. But if you all take a closer look, the lines on these few figures are not full enough. There is an obvious gradient shown on the lines and color. This is a defect caused by machines, and it’s very subtle so many people can’t actually tell…”</p>  <p id = > As the crowd listened to Russell’s explanation, they finally realized the truth.</p>  <p id = > “So, it’s a fake! Charles Johnston, you’re too much!”</p>  <p id = > “Yeah! After a whole day of suspense, you ended up showing us a fake instead! What gives?”</p>  <p id = > In an instant, the crowd started unleashing their dissatisfaction. Charles was now nervous and ashamed. How could it be a fake? How was it possible?</p>  <p id = > Aiden frowned hard as he stood aside, looking at Philip, who was still standing in a corner. Suddenly, he tugged Charles’s arm and whispered into the man’s ear, “Uncle Johnston, could Philip have taken the wrong painting?”</p>  <p id = > Took the wrong painting? Charles immediately came to his senses. It must be! Philip must have taken the wrong painting!</p>  <p id = > No sooner said than done, Charles ignored the criticism by the crowd. He hastened over to Philip, giving him another slap as he roared in anger, “Philip, did you bring that fake painting of yours over instead?! Were you trying to embarrass me on purpose?”</p>  <p id = > Charles was furious. He had gone through so much trouble to plan this exhibition, hoping that it could raise his fame. But now, a colossal misunderstanding had occurred instead. This was just too embarrassing. Charles considered himself a little well-known in the collectors’ community, so he chose to vent his frustrations on Philip.</p>  <p id = > When Russell saw this, his anger flared up immediately. He wanted to go over to stop Charles, but Philip shot him a cold glare.</p>  <p id = > Philip then quickly said, “I’m sorry, Dad. I took the wrong one. I’ll go back now and get it again.”</p>  <p id = > “Go, now!” Charles was seething, his gaze ice-cold. How could he have such a useless son-in-law?</p>  <p id = > Aiden was standing behind Charles with a cold smile playing on his lip. The man was overflowing with provocative intentions. After Philip had rushed out, Aiden continued to whisper in Charles’s ear, “Uncle Johnston, the way I see it, Philip must have done it on purpose. It’s clear that he dislikes you, but you’re still his father-in-law no matter what. For him to embarrass you in such an important event is just…”</p>  <p id = > “Hmph! He’s a piece of trash! Once I get back, I’ll have Wynn divorce him immediately!” Charles cut off Aiden’s words, still boiling with anger.</p>  <p id = > Aiden was ecstatic. He had now reached his goal, so he quietly clenched his fists in victory. Haha, Wynn Johnston will soon belong to me!</p>  <p id = > After Philip left, Charlese apologetically said, “I’m sorry everyone, it was the wrong painting. I’ve already sent my son-in-law back home to get the correct one.”</p>  <p id = > As Charles kept apologizing, someone perked up and asked, “Charles, what do you mean by ‘wrong painting’? Do you actually have two of the same piece?”</p>  <p id = > Charles was about to speak up when Aiden cut in and explained with a laugh, “It’s like this. It was Uncle Johnston’s birthday a few days ago. Me and Uncle Johnston’s son-in-law, Philip, had both prepared a present each, which was the painting, Companionship at the Spring Mountains. This fake piece was bought by Uncle Johnston’s son-in-law from an antique market to give to Uncle Johnston. As for the real thing, I had spent two million dollars on buying it from a friend to give to Uncle Johnston. And that trash, Philip ended up bringing the wrong one…”</p>  <p id = > After that explanation, everyone seemed to have a better idea. In an instant, the people in the hall started dismissing Philip.</p>  <p id = > “There’s someone who would actually buy art from an antique market to give to their father-in-law as a gift! What a cheapskate.”</p>  <p id = > “Sigh, it’s not news. Charles’s son-in-law is publicly known to be a useless piece of trash.”</p>  <p id = > “I think Aiden is a nice young man, and Charles’s daughter is beautiful. They should become a couple instead.”</p>  <p id = > Among the crowd, Russell’s expression darkened as he listened to these discussions. These people did not know that Mr. Clarke was an elite, rich man who could afford to invest two billion without hesitation!</p>  <p id = > Russell had already figured out the situation by now from the explanations. The painting he had given Mr. Clarke was the genuine piece, but Charles Johnston, who had favored power instead thought the painting from Philip was a fake. The counterfeit was then treated as the authentic piece while the real thing was cast aside as a fake.</p>  <p id = > The painting that Philip was going home to take now was the painting Russell himself had given to him. Only, after Aiden’s words earlier, everyone now assumed that the one Philip had gone home to take was the one given by Aiden.</p>  <p id = > Russell stroked his chin as a faint smirk appeared on his lips. Alright, he would just put that impertinent brat, Aiden, to shame as a way of helping Mr. Clarke vent.</p>  <p id = > Soon, Philip had returned with another painting. By now, Theo was still mixed in with the crowd as he watched quietly.</p>  <p id = > Charles went over to Philip personally and snatched the painting from him while he berated, “Trash! Go stand in a corner! I’ll take care of you when I get back!”</p>  <p id = > Philip let out a helpless sigh and smiled dryly before returning to stand in a corner.</p>  <p id = > The painting was presented again. Charles immediately invited Russell to appraise this new piece. “Master Russell, please take a look at this. This is the real painting.”</p>  <p id = > Russell pretended to think out loud, nodding and praising as he looked, “Wonderful, now this is the real thing! It’s Tang Bohu’s authentic painting!”</p>  <p id = > Upon hearing this, Charles’s flurry of emotions finally calmed down, and he could not conceal the smile on his face.</p>  <p id = > However, Russell’s next sentence stunned everyone in the exhibition hall. “Mr. Grant, was it? Are you sure this painting is the one you bought from your friend?” Russell smiled at Aiden, who was looking to be very full of himself.</p>               <h2 id =chapter-35 > Chapter 35</h2> <p id = > “Of course,” answered Aiden proudly.</p>  <p id = > Russell already knew that Aiden would say this. Hiding a smile, he continued to ask, “May I know which friend did Mr. Grant buy this from?”</p>  <p id = > Upon hearing this, the delight on Aiden’s face grew. Could Russell want to be acquainted with that friend of his? This was an excellent opportunity for him to befriend Russell. “President Field, his name is David White, the owner of an antique market. He’s quite famous. I can call him over this instant.” Aiden smiled.</p>  <p id = > “There’s no need.” Russell waved then took out his phone to say smilingly, “I’m acquainted with David White.”</p>  <p id = > Of course, Russell knew David White. The man was a famous antique market owner, but at the same time, he had a notorious reputation within the community. The reason was that David was an expert at selling counterfeits and forged pieces. He often sold off his fakes to people who did not know better, and it looked like David had tricked Aiden.</p>  <p id = > However, Russell did not feel an ounce of pity for him. He dialed the number and said faintly, “Mr. White, how are you doing?”</p>  <p id = > On the other end of the call came the steady voice of a middle-aged man. With the typical tone of a dishonest trader and a voice deliberately pitched high, the man said, “Oh my, why did Master Russell call me up so suddenly today? Are you coming to take a look at some goods?”</p>  <p id = > David was currently at his antique market shop, sitting on his vintage wooden armchair as he sipped on some tea.</p>  <p id = > “Stop with all that nonsense and make a trip over to Civil Gallery,” Russell said rudely then hung up.</p>  <p id = > David was not infuriated by this. Instead, he quickly started up his Porsche and drove straight to Civil Gallery.</p>  <p id = > Aiden was still smiling in an attempt to flatter Russell as he said, “Master Russell knows Mr. White too? What a coincidence!”</p>  <p id = > Russell did not say anything but sat down at a coffee table in a corner quietly, waiting for David. He looked at Aiden like he was staring at an idiot while the boy continued to praise him.</p>  <p id = > Everyone else, too, was standing beside Russell, waiting quietly. Although they did not know why Russell had called David over, it must have something to do with the painting.</p>  <p id = > Suddenly, a phone rang. In a corner, Philip received a text message from Russell, reading: Mr. Clarke, please don’t worry. I’ll teach this Aiden a lesson on your behalf.</p>  <p id = > Philip looked up to see Russell smiling at him. After giving it a little thought, Philip decided not to stop him.</p>  <p id = > Aiden, who had caught sight of this, was instantly annoyed. He went to Russell’s side and gossiped, “President Field, you shouldn’t waste your time on that Philip.”</p>  <p id = > Russell’s expression darkened, but he did not say anything. On the inside, he had already jotted Aiden’s name down in his list of hated things.</p>  <p id = > In less than ten minutes, a short, plump man in a suit named David White, appeared at the gallery. This guy’s face was glowing as he smiled at everyone he saw, looking like the god of laughter. “Master Russell, I’m here. Do you need me for anything urgent?” David hastened over to Russell in big steps and a flattering smile.</p>  <p id = > When Aiden saw David, he smiled and nodded at the man as a form of greeting. It was thanks to David’s painting that he could earn such high praise today.</p>  <p id = > Russell glanced at David then said faintly, “Well done, David. Your business seems to be going well.”</p>  <p id = > David was stunned. He bowed and answered, “That’s not true. It’s all thanks to Master Russell’s patronage.”</p>  <p id = > “Hmph!” Suddenly, there was a loud thud! Russell had slammed a hand onto the coffee table and pointed to the painting on the wall with great fury. “David White, is that the painting you sold?”</p>  <p id = > This sudden confrontation made David’s whole body shudder as sweat fell like raindrops.</p>  <p id = > The bystanders, too, were stunned at this, unable to understand what was going on.</p>  <p id = > David was naturally afraid because it was Russell who supported him in his earlier days that he had managed to make something of himself today. After his business had grown, he did not stay in contact with Russell as often, and they were considered to have parted ways.</p>  <p id = > However, David never dared to behave rashly in front of Russell. He quickly turned to look at the glass display, and in an instant, his knees went weak! It was the Companionship at the Spring Mountains!</p>  <p id = > Sh*t! He could no longer conceal the fact that he had sold a counterfeit. More importantly, the real painting of Companionship at the Spring Mountains had always belonged to Russell, so the one hanging there must be a fake!</p>          <h2 id =chapter-36 > Chapter 36</h2> <p id = > “Master Russell, please let me explain.” David was anxious as large drops of sweat rolled down his forehead.</p>  <p id = > Aiden was confused as he asked, “Mr. White, what’s wrong with you?”</p>  <p id = > David was troubled. He now knew why Russell had called him over, so he quickly said to Aiden, “Mr. Grant, I’m sorry. The painting that I sold you last time was a fake. I’ll refund you the money as soon as I get back.”</p>  <p id = > “A fake?” Aiden shrieked. The crowd of people standing behind him all gasped, looking incredulous. Charles looked especially shocked and was utterly stunned.</p>  <p id = > “Mr. White, what do you mean? What do you mean by ‘a fake’? I’ve spent two million to buy it!” Aiden was getting flustered, feeling his body alternate between hot and cold. “And Master Russell had said earlier that that painting is an authentic piece. Are you drunk?”</p>  <p id = > David was now like a cat on a hot tin roof. Upon hearing the words ‘authentic piece’, he rushed over to the glass display and looked carefully at it before exclaiming, “This… this isn’t the one I sold you!”</p>  <p id = > Of course, it was not. The others did not notice it, but David did. On the bottom right most corner of the painting, a few tiny words were stamped there, reading, ‘Received by Russell Field’. Everyone had been too focused on the painting that they did not notice this detail because there were just too many stamps at the bottom.</p>  <p id = > “What? This isn’t the one you sold me?” Aiden was dumbstruck, feeling shocked. He had a bad feeling about this.</p>  <p id = > Charles exclaimed in surprise, “Master Russell, Mr. White, just what is going on?”</p>  <p id = > Russell snorted. He got up and strode over to David. After glaring at the shorter man, Russell announced, “This painting is genuine, but it’s not the one Mr. Grant bought.”</p>  <p id = > “Impossible, how could this authentic painting be…” Charles frowned hard. He was at a loss for words amidst his confusion.</p>  <p id = > Just then, David had noticed the painting that was discarded on the ground. He picked it up, opened it, then exclaimed excitedly, “This! This is the one I sold to Mr. Grant.”</p>  <p id = > The crowd looked toward the sound source to find that David was holding the fake painting that Charles had tossed into a corner earlier. In an instant, everyone’s expression changed! What was going on?</p>  <p id = > Charles was now trembling in anger. Without caring for appearances, his face was blood-red as he roared, “Aiden, what is going on?! That fake painting is yours?”</p>  <p id = > Of course, Aiden refused to admit it. He groaned, “How is that possible? I’ve spent two million to buy that painting, so how can it be a fake?” He then turned to glare at David. “Mr. White, you can’t lie through your teeth. Take a proper look again, that real painting is the one I bought from you.”</p>  <p id = > How could David ever have the courage to lie now? With Master Russell here, he would never dare to twist the facts even if he was given ten folds of courage. David quickly said, “Mr. Grant, I’m really sorry. You didn’t know anything about paintings back then, so I gave you a counterfeit instead. But don’t worry, I refund you three million later. That extra one million will be my compensation for you.”</p>  <p id = > “Who the hell wants your one million?!” Aiden exploded in anger. He now understood that the fake painting earlier was actually the one he had bought. And this genuine painting…</p>  <p id = > Everyone shifted their gaze to Philip, who was standing in a corner with an innocent expression. “I… I just bought it randomly from an antique market.”</p>  <p id = > Holy sh*t! The guy had actually gotten a real painting by randomly choosing one! What a lucky b*stard!</p>  <p id = > Although Charles was irked, at least one of the paintings was real.</p>  <p id = > “Hmph! Aiden, you have actually tried to trick me with a counterfeit!” Charles was furious. “Don’t ever come to my house again, and all those gifts that you’ve brought over, take them back with you!”</p>  <p id = > Aiden was unable to clear his name. He had no idea why David would say this in front of everyone. What would the man get out of it? Clenching his fists in a fury, Aiden glared at Philip before turning to leave. This day was just too embarrassing! More importantly, Uncle Johnston had now completely lost any favor for him.</p>  <p id = > After Aiden left, Charles asked David as he still felt puzzled, “Mr. White, how did you differentiate that this painting is your counter-…” Charles did not finish his words in fear of upsetting David. The man was still a famous figure within the antique market after all.</p>  <p id = > David smiled and said, “Mr. Johnston, this authentic painting had actually always belonged to Ru-...”</p>  <p id = > Ahem! Ahem! Before David could finish, Russell coughed for a bit, interrupting him. The latter then shot a few eye signals at David.</p>  <p id = > David immediately understood and corrected himself, “How could I not recognize my own forged goods?”</p>  <p id = > That sounded weird.</p>  <p id = > After this commotion, everyone now knew that Charles Johnston’s useless son-in-law had randomly bought this authentic Chinese painting from an antique market. Such a lucky b*stard!</p>  <p id = > When everyone was ready to start fawning over Russell again, the man shuffled his feet and walked to Philip with a big smile. “Mr. Cla-… Young man, you have great luck. Here is my name card.” Russell handed Philip a small card.</p>  <p id = > Philip nodded faintly and took it. He knew that Russell was only doing this for the public’s eyes.</p>  <p id = > “Philip, why are you spacing out? Thank Master Russell immediately!” When Charles saw Philip’s dull reaction, his face darkened.</p>  <p id = > “Thank you, Master Russell.” Philip quickly smiled.</p>  <p id = > Russell dared not receive it and could barely stand straight, so he only smiled dryly in return.</p>  <p id = > Philip’s nonchalant attitude earlier had, of course, annoyed a lot of people. They started mocking him.</p>  <p id = > “Master Russell has actually given his name card to a wretched piece of trash.”</p>  <p id = > “What of it? It’s only a name card. Trash will still be trash.”</p>  <p id = > “Look at that idiotic face. He’s definitely a good-for-nothing.”</p>  <p id = > Philip paid no mind to these insults and mockery. He continued to stand quietly in a corner.</p>  <p id = > Just then, his phone rang. It was a call from Lynn. After a glance at the time, he figured that Lynn was probably getting impatient about taking care of Mila and had called to chase him home.</p>  <p id = > When the call got through, Philip sounded apologetic as he said, “Lynn, I’m sorry, I’ll be back soon.”</p>  <p id = > “Cou… Cousin brother-in-law…” Lynn was not rude to him like she usually was. Instead, she sounded as if she was crying as she spoke fearfully, “Mi… Mila has gone missing.”</p>                 <h2 id =chapter-37 > Chapter 37</h2> <p id = > This news came like a bolt from the blue! Philip was stunned for a few seconds before he finally digested Lynn’s words. His tone instantly shot up a few decibels. “Mila’s missing?! Where are you?”</p>  <p id = > This was urgent! Philip felt like someone had kicked him hard on the chest. His back was now drenched with sweat.</p>  <p id = > “Brother-in-law, I’m at Millennium Amusement Park, I only…” Lynn sounded distinctly flustered over the phone. Her background was noisy with sounds of people frolicking about.</p>  <p id = > “Wait there. I’m coming!” Philip roared. Mila was missing! He no longer had time for the people in the gallery as he hurried outside.</p>  <p id = > Behind him, Russell called out to him a few times, but Philip did not respond. Charles added words of contempt, saying Philip had no manners and that he was rushing to his death.</p>  <p id = > Philip did not dare to tell Charles that Mila was missing, thinking that the old man might not even care for Mila’s safety at all. To them, Mila’s birth was a humiliation to the Johnston family because Philip and Wynn had given birth to her before they had even gotten married. This incident had brought shame to the Johnston family, embarrassed Charles, and caused Wynn significant damage.</p>  <p id = > Upon exiting the gallery, Philip ran into Theo, who had been waiting outside. Philip anxiously said, “To Millennium Amusement Park, quick!”</p>  <p id = > Theo did not bother asking questions. Philip looked so anxious as if the sky was about to fall. After they got in, Theo hastily started up the car and drove them to Millennium Amusement Park.</p>  <p id = > On the way, Philip kept urging Theo to go faster, so Theo finally asked, “Mr. Clarke, what’s going on? It sounds really urgent. Do you need my help?”</p>  <p id = > Philip immediately calmed down to think. “My daughter has gone missing in Millennium Amusement Park. Get your men to search around quickly. We must find her!”</p>  <p id = > It was no wonder that Philip was so distressed. Who would not be if their child had gone missing? What was more, Mila was Philip’s whole world! If she got kidnapped by a human trafficker, the consequences would be frightening.</p>  <p id = > When Theo heard this, his whole body tensed up. He quickly dug out his phone to call his henchman, “Tiger, hurry, mobilize everyone in the company! With Millennium Amusement Park as the center point, search ten kilometers within the area and find a child!”</p>  <p id = > “Mr. Clarke, do you have a photo of your daughter? Send me one, and I’ll get my people to search. We’ll post up a missing person’s ad everywhere we can in the city.”</p>  <p id = > Philip sent Mila’s photo to Theo.</p>  <p id = > Soon, they reached Millennium Amusement Park. From afar, around five young people could be seen standing at the entrance, anxiously waiting for someone.</p>  <p id = > The moment Philip got out of the car, he ran over to them. “Lynn, where’s Mila? Where did she go missing? Did you get the staff to make an announcement?”</p>  <p id = > Lynn clearly looked distressed. She said through sobs, “Brother-in-law, I… I don’t know either. I was playing with my friends, and when I turned around, Mila had gone missing.”</p>  <p id = > “Yeah, that kid was just too noisy.”</p>  <p id = > “Uncle, you can’t blame us for your kid running off on her own.”</p>  <p id = > The other youngsters started pushing the responsibility to Philip, looking like this had nothing to do with them.</p>  <p id = > Philip frowned hard. He did not have time for any nonsense with them. Watching Lynn’s flustered expression and did not dare to meet his eyes, Philip knew Lynn was not honest.</p>  <p id = > “Lynn Johnston!” Philip roared as he closed in a few steps. “You better tell me the truth. Where’s Mila? How did you lose her?!” Philip had unleashed the worry and anger he had accumulated on the way here in this one roar. Lynn was immediately stunned and started crying as she pouted.</p>  <p id = > The youngsters behind her got annoyed and started pushing Philip. Particularly a boy dressed up like a gangster with an upturned braid and earrings shielded Lynn like he was the boss and warned Philip, “Hey, hey, Uncle, what are you doing? Who are you trying to threaten her? Your daughter’s missing because she deserved it! She kept running around like a little b*tch!”</p>  <p id = > Slap! All of a sudden, Philip gave the boy a tight slap.</p>  <p id = > The young man held a hand to his hand and looked bewildered as he stared at Philip. “F*ck! You f*cking hit me! Do you have any idea who I am? Just wait, I’ll call someone over to beat you up!”</p>  <p id = > Philip’s expression darkened. Why are these youngsters all so uneducated? They had caused a person to go missing but was still so arrogant.</p>  <p id = > Theo had now come out from the amusement park office and saw from afar that Philip was getting into a dispute with these kids. “Brat, who were you trying to have beat up? Try saying it one more time.” Theo hastened over with a menacing look as he rolled up his sleeves to show his tattoos.</p>  <p id = > When the boy saw the buffed Theo with his frightening expression and tattoos, he instantly shrunk away and mumbled under his breath.</p>  <p id = > Philip had no time for him. He turned to ask solemnly, “Lynn Johnston, tell me the truth! How did Mila go missing?”</p>  <p id = > Lynn lowered her head, not daring to say a word.</p>  <p id = > “Tell me!” Philip roared.</p>    <h2 id =chapter-38 > Chapter 38</h2> <p id = > Lynn glanced at her friends, looking aggrieved, then finally stuttered, “I… I accidentally… left her alone. This was all because she kept fussing about wanting to go home and kept running around, so I taught her a lesson. Have I done anything wrong?” Lynn was still filled with grievances at the start, but as she spoke, she ended up getting more agitated, as if unwilling to admit that this was her fault.</p>  <p id = > “What’s more, Mila’s your daughter, not mine. Why should I have to look after her? If she’s missing, that’s her fault!” Lynn refused to take this responsibility. This had nothing to do with her. It was all Mila’s fault! It was because that little b*tch, who was an embarrassment to the family, was such an eyesore!</p>  <p id = > Philip was really furious. He never expected Lynn to be this unreasonable but still so proud of herself. “Lynn Johnston, I’m warning you. If Mila is not found at the end of today, I will make you regret this for the rest of your life!” Philip pointed at Lynn and admonished. He was now boiling with anger. Had Lynn not been Wynn’s cousin sister, he would have slapped her a few times now!</p>  <p id = > Beside him, Theo whispered, “Mr. Clarke, I’ve already informed the broadcasting room to start searching. Let’s go to the control room.”</p>  <p id = > Philip nodded, then turned to follow Theo as they rushed toward the control room.</p>  <p id = > Lynn and her friends exchanged glances. Until after Philip was gone, Lynn kicked the air furiously and scolded, “Philip Clarke, who the f*ck do you think you are? That little b*tch is better off being kidnapped by human traffickers!” Lynn was angry because that trash, Philip had actually raised his voice at her, embarrassing her in front of her friends.</p>  <p id = > “Lynnie, is that idiot your cousin brother-in-law?” The boy who had been slapped by Philip earlier was staring resentfully in the direction Philip disappeared off to as he asked through gritted teeth.</p>  <p id = > Lynn nodded reluctantly. “He’s just a wretched piece of trash living under my cousin sister’s expenses.”</p>  <p id = > “Sh*t! A kept man?” Jeremy Hill got even more annoyed. It was such an embarrassment to be frightened by a kept man, so he had to get his dignity back! “Let’s go and follow them. My dad’s the supervisor of this amusement park. If they want to look for a missing person, they have to go through my dad.” Jeremy said coldly, “I won’t take this lying down. I will have him kneel and apologize or else he can forget about finding that little b*tch!”</p>  <p id = > Lynn frowned slightly at this. Truth be told, she was against the idea because Philip was her cousin brother-in-law after all. If her cousin sister found out about this, she would be in big trouble. However, Lynn, too, could not tolerate how Philip had treated her earlier. How dare a piece of trash to raise his voice at her? How despicable!</p>  <p id = > “Lynnie, don’t worry. I’ll stand up for you. He’s just a piece of trash.” Jeremy smirked as a plan formed in his mind.</p>  <p id = > With that said, the group followed after Philip and Theo.</p>  <p id = > Back to Philip, once he and Theo reached the control room, they immediately explained their situation. The staff inside quickly started up the surveillance records and Philip stood in front of more than ten videos as he carefully searched for Mila’s silhouette.</p>  <p id = > “Mr. Clarke, please stay here and watch the cameras, I’ll go and get my men,” Theo said respectfully.</p>  <p id = > Philip did not think too much of it and nodded.</p>  <p id = > Outside the door, Theo hastily made a few phone calls, getting all of his men to move out and search!</p>  <p id = > In an instant, the whole of the underground world in Riverdale City was mobilized! In a short span of time, the photo of an energetic and adorable little girl was plastered on the wall of every mall, every shop, and every entertainment establishment.</p>  <p id = > Over at Philip’s side, he was currently staring meticulously at the surveillance cameras, feeling anxious on the inside. Mila was his everything, she was also Wynn’s everything. If Mila was really missing, Philip did not know how he should live on or how he should face Wynn.</p>  <p id = > “This is it, this is the one! Playback!” In the video, Philip could see Lynn and her group with a little girl following behind. The little girl kept looking around, seemingly elated but at the same time, afraid. It was Mila!</p>  <p id = > Due to her congenital heart disease, Philip rarely took her out to play and Wynn disallowed it. The last time Philip took her to an amusement park, that incident happened. To this day, Wynn was still angry at Philip about it.</p>  <p id = > What was more heart-wrenching was that Lynn and her group had completely ignored the little girl behind them. They were only focused on having fun and taking pictures. As for Mila, she had to keep running to keep up with their pace. When she fell a few times, she had slowly picked herself up and then continued to chase after the group. This was too heartbreaking. The little girl was only three years old! That f*cking Lynn Johnston!</p>  <p id = > The next few scenes completely enraged Philip. His knuckles turned pale as the fury in his eyes was like turbulent waves! It seemed like Mila was telling them that she wanted to go home. Lynn had slapped her angrily and pointed at her nose as she berated her with unpleasant words. The worse thing was, Lynn had then left Mila there alone and went away with her friends.</p>  <p id = > On the screen, Mila was standing there, crying helplessly as she screamed for her Papa and Mama. After that, she wiped her tears and started walking around the amusement park aimlessly and fearfully.</p>  <p id = > Philip’s heart was bleeding. He could barely control his anger now. Mila, a three-year-old little girl, was just left alone in the crowded amusement park by Lynn and her friends. Philip did not dare to imagine how helpless, how pitiful, and how scared his daughter was.</p>  <p id = > “Lynn Johnston! Screw you!” Philip broke the skin on his lips as he forced those words out with bloodshot eyes. So what if she was Wynn’s cousin sister? So what if she was the precious treasure of the Johnston family’s second uncle? She was just digging her own grave by treating Mila this way!</p>  <p id = > Suddenly, the door of the control room was pushed open, and about seven people entered the room. Jeremy and his group, too, entered smugly.</p>  <p id = > In the lead was a middle-aged man wearing a navy suit and exuding an impressive aura.</p>  <p id = > “Who is Philip Clarke?”</p>         <h2 id =chapter-39 > Chapter 39</h2> <p id = > A group of people barged in with the leading middle-aged man looking to be very powerful. He was wearing an expensive suit and had the air of an authority figure as he bellowed the moment he stepped into the room, shocking the staff inside the control room. The staff quickly greeted, “Mr. Hill, what brings you here?”</p>  <p id = > Harold Hill was the supervisor of Millennium Amusement Park, in charge of the facilities, workers, security, and operation within the park. In summary, other than the owner, Harold was the second in command at Millennium Amusement Park.</p>  <p id = > Harold nodded slightly. With a sharp gaze, he asked again, coldly, “Who is Philip Clarke?”</p>  <p id = > Philip mildly frowned and took a step forward. “I am.”</p>  <p id = > The few youngsters behind Harold rushed into the room and blocked the exit. The young boy Philip had slapped earlier, Jeremy Hill, was now pointing arrogantly at him as he said, “Dad, it’s him. He’s the one who slapped me earlier. You have to teach him a tough lesson!”</p>  <p id = > So, they were here to pick a fight. Philip cocked up an eyebrow and glanced at the youngsters. He did not see Lynn among them and assumed that she did not have the courage to come inside.</p>  <p id = > “You’re the one who hit my son?” Harold was furious. His son was his treasure, and he never had the heart to lay a hand on him. But today, a poorly dressed man had actually hit his son!</p>  <p id = > Philip did not bother to explain but asked faintly, “What do you want?”</p>  <p id = > “Hehe, good. I see you have a temper.” Harold looked condescendingly at him. “Apologize to my son and we’ll consider this settled. Or else, don’t even think about stepping outside this door.” At his words, the staff inside the control room scattered away to block off the doors, looking like guards.</p>  <p id = > Harold stared coldly at Philip, but the latter snorted. “Shouldn’t you ask why your son got slapped?” How did this man become someone’s father? He just came over without clarifying the situation and asked for an apology. It was no wonder his son was so full of himself. He had learned it from his old man. It was such a miracle that this pair of father and son could still live comfortably.</p>  <p id = > “I don’t care why. He’s my son, and you hit him, so you must apologize!” Harold’s voice was deep as he brought out his air of superiority, exerting his dominance. Who was this fool who dared to question him in return? The man clearly did not know his place, such an idiot!</p>  <p id = > With a dark expression, Harold pushed his son forward. “Jeremy, how do you want to take care of this? Dad will let you do as you please. If you want him to kneel, I’ll make him kneel even if he refuses. Didn’t he slap you earlier? Go over and slap him ten times. Don’t worry. Dad will be here to take care of things for you.”</p>  <p id = > Jeremy was now acting like a little drama queen with wings growing on his back. He lifted his chin proudly and pointed at Philip. “You, kneel now, and apologize.” He was so cheeky and arrogant. Feels great to have my old man back me up. Didn’t you slap me just now? I will return that favor to you by ten folds!</p>  <p id = > Philip frowned. He was worried about Mila right now and had no time for any nonsense with these unreasonable people. He said coldly, “I’d advise you all not to provoke me.” If this affected his search for his daughter, Philip would not mind making this pair of father and son experience the taste of a broken family.</p>  <p id = > Upon hearing this, Harold held his sides in laughter. “Hey, bro, are you threatening me? Do you know who I am?” This fool here dared to threaten him. This has never happened in so many years.</p>  <p id = > “I don’t care who you are. I have urgent matters now, so please make way.” Philip’s eyes turned ice-cold, and then, he moved to force his way out.</p>  <p id = > However, with the wave of his hand, Harold ordered solemnly, “Hold him down! Today, I will let this blind fool here know what happens when someone provokes Harold Hill!”</p>  <p id = > In an instant, the staff surrounded Philip, and it seemed like a dispute was about to break out.</p>  <p id = > Suddenly, a stern voice bellowed from the entrance. “Stop! What are you doing?” Theo had returned with his head covered in sweat. He barged in, shoving the people away to stand in front of Philip, shielding him as he glared at Harold with a menacing expression like that of a venomous snake. What was this group of people trying to do? They had a death wish for attempting to lay a hand on Mr. Clarke!</p>  <p id = > Harold’s expression fell dark. He was here to stand up for his son, so why were there so many troublesome issues? “And who the f*ck are you? Scram!” Harold barked unpleasantly as he boiled with rage.</p>  <p id = > “You don’t know me?” Theo asked in return, frowning.</p>  <p id = > Harold was stunned. After staring at Theo for a moment, he broke out in laughter. “Are you an idiot? Why the hell should I know you? Oh, you’re his friend? Okay, then don’t think about leaving either. You can both kneel and apologize to my son.”</p>  <p id = > Harold really had a death wish. Standing right before him was none other than the mob king, Theo Zander! When was the last time someone pointed at Theo and insulted him? That would be around the time he started as a gangster. Now, more than ten years had passed and no one dared to speak that way to him ever again. Harold Hill was the first, and also the last. Because in Theo’s eyes, he was already a dead man.</p>  <p id = > However, Harold had no idea how many times he had died in Theo’s mind. He really did not know Theo Zander but have only ever heard of him.</p>   <h2 id =chapter-40 > Chapter 40</h2> <p id = > “My name’s Theo Zander! Now take your people with you and scram!” Theo roared. This was the first time he felt humiliated, and it even happened right in front of Mr. Clarke. Would Mr. Clarke suspect his capabilities because of this?</p>  <p id = > “Theo Zander? What’s that? I don’t know it.” Harold was a short-tempered man. He was the manager of a huge amusement park and had stayed in that high position for so many years now, so it was only natural that his temper was a little shorter. “Stop talking nonsense and quickly apologize to my son, or else, don’t even think about leaving!”</p>  <p id = > Theo Zander? Why does that sound a little familiar? Forget it! Can he be more powerful than I am? I’m the manager here, the king!</p>  <p id = > Theo was fuming with anger. With a reddened face, he pointed at Harold and roared, “Just try to even f*cking move!” Sh*t, this guy really thought he was a small fry!</p>  <p id = > “What are you standing there for? Get them! Or do you all want to get fired?” Harold bellowed at his stall.</p>  <p id = > The workers exchanged glances. What was this situation? Yet, they could not disobey because, with just one sentence from Manager Hill, they would lose their jobs.</p>  <p id = > “We’re really sorry, sirs. Or why don’t you guys apologize to Manager Hill?” A staff member forced a smile.</p>  <p id = > “Preposterous! Whoever lays a hand on Mr. Clarke means offending me, Theo Zander!” Theo shouted. He then took out his phone to make a call, sounding furious as he said, “Tiger, bring some men to the amusement park now!”</p>  <p id = > Seeing Theo calling for backup, Harold, too, wasted no time to call for his. “Get the security team over. I will see just how f*cking invincible you are!”</p>  <p id = > The anger from both sides was huge. They were like two barrels of explosives, and what was left was for a comet to crash.</p>  <p id = > Philip, who was standing behind Theo, had no more time to waste. “Mila is still in the amusement park. Get your men here to search the place. I do not wish to have my time disrupted, do you understand?”</p>  <p id = > Theo respectfully replied, “Mr. Clarke, I’m sorry. This incident must have startled you. I’ve already arranged for my men to come over, and we’ll immediately take care of this madman.”</p>  <p id = > Philip nodded and stood quietly aside to watch.</p>  <p id = > Soon, five men in black security guard outfits rushed into the tiny room. They were all holding something that looked like electric shock batons.</p>  <p id = > “Brother-in-law, the second security team has assembled. Please give your orders on who we should take out.” The security guards’ team leader, Darius Ziegler, was standing respectfully in front of Harold, smiling brightly. This man was Harold’s brother-in-law.</p>  <p id = > Harold pointed at Theo and Philip. “It’s the two of them. Grab them and beat them up first. If anything happens, I’ll take responsibility.”</p>  <p id = > When Darius heard this, he immediately smiled as he looked at Theo. With a wave of his hand, he commanded, “Brothers, get to work.”</p>  <p id = > Seeing as the security guards were about to come over, Theo’s eyes widened in anger as he roared, “If any of you dares to do anything, I, Theo Zander, won’t let you off!”</p>  <p id = > Darius and his brother-in-law had the same revolting behavior. He chided, “Theo Zander? Do you think you’re the mob king of Riverdale City? With the likes of you and that tattoo, are you pretending to be some bigshot? I think you just have the same name! Who are you trying to scare? Get you ass over here and quietly prostrate or you’ll get a taste of this electric baton.” The baton in his hand shot blue electric sparks, making a crackling sound.</p>  <p id = > Darius started walking toward Theo and Philip with a cold smile. “Will you kneel, or not?”</p>  <p id = > Just then, an angry roar sounded from behind the group! “Move the f*ck away!”</p>  <p id = > More than ten muscular men strode over. The leading man sported a buzz-cut, wearing a short-sleeved navy green shirt and long pants. His tanned skin made him look so much stronger and powerful. This line-up looked so impressive, so overbearing!</p>  <p id = > The strong men pushed the few security guards aside like they were little chicks.</p>  <p id = > “Who the f*ck are you guys? Can’t you see that I’m busy?” Darius yelled in dissatisfaction.</p>  <p id = > “Shut up!” When Harold saw the tiger tattoo on the arm of the buffed leading man, his expression changed. His forehead was covered in sweat, and he gave his brother-in-law a tight slap across his face.</p>  <p id = > “Brother-in-law?” Darius held a hand to his cheek, looking incredulously at Harold.</p>  <p id = > However, Harold had already hastened over to the newcomer with a big smile and bending slightly. “Oh my, Brother Tiger, what a rare guest! What brings you here?”</p>  <p id = > Seeing Harold suddenly put on a smiling face instantly confused everyone. Who was this person? Why did Manager Hill seem to be afraid of him?</p>  <p id = > “Could it be THAT Brother Tiger? The fiercest general of our mob king, Theo Zander?”</p>  <p id = > “Holy sh*t! That can’t be! Brother Tiger? He’s the top dog of Lord North Street. Even Manager Hill has to bow when he sees him!”</p>  <p id = > “Why is he here? Could Theo Zander, Lord Theo, be here as well?”</p>  <p id = > Harold’s men were exclaiming in hushed voices.</p>  <p id = > While everyone was still lost in confusion, Brother Tiger ignored Harold who had come up to him and just pushed the man away.</p>  <p id = > Under Harold’s startled gaze, Brother Tiger led his men over to Theo and Philip, then he bowed, saying, “Brother Theo, Mr. Clarke, sorry I’m late.”</p>  <p id = > The muscular men in black clothing behind Tiger bowed in unison. “Hello Brother Theo, Hello Mr. Clarke.”</p>  <p id = > The room fell into a pin drop silence. Everyone present looked incredulously at Theo and Philip. Their eyes widened in disbelief.</p>  <p id = > Jeremy Hill and his father, Harold were both dumbstruck as they stood like statues, rooted to the spot. Their hands were even trembling slightly. They were baffled. Just what was going on?</p>    <h2 id =chapter-41 > Chapter 41</h2> <p id = > Harold’s scalp was feeling prickly. His face was pale. “Brother Tiger, you’re...”</p>  <p id = > Tiger Zander finally noticed him. He looked up in surprise and asked, “Manager Hill, what are you doing here?”</p>  <p id = > What the… Harold felt like he was about to vomit blood. Did Tiger really not see him standing there? This was his amusement park, after all, his turf! However, Harold did not have the time to mind that now. When he recalled Tiger’s respectful attitude as the man addressed that two people earlier, Harold had a bad feeling about it. He forced out a smile and asked, “Brother Tiger, these two people are…”</p>  <p id = > “This is my older brother, Theo Zander, Brother Theo. And this is Mr. Clarke, my brother’s honored guest,” answered Tiger.</p>  <p id = > Tiger Zander was the top dog of Lord North Street, and Millennium Amusement Park was situated in this Lord North Street. Harold had been working here for many years now, so he naturally knew Tiger Zander’s strength and influence. He also knew that Tiger’s backer was the mob king of Riverdale City, Theo Zander!</p>  <p id = > At this point, Harold’s face was pale as a sheet. Oh no… oh no… Did I just scold Theo Zander? And I even asked Lord Zander’s honored guest to kneel and apologize to my son? Wait… My brother-in-law seemed to have said worse things.</p>  <p id = > “Lord… Lord Zander… Mr. Clarke…” Harold could feel his legs shaking. It’s over. Who have I provoked?! Harold was wailing out loud inside. He knew full well that his next actions would determine whether he would survive this incident.</p>  <p id = > By now, Tiger seemed to have realized that something was wrong. Although he was ripped and a man among men, he was quite sensitive on the inside. Otherwise, he would have never become Theo’s number one general!</p>  <p id = > Tiger put on a greasy smile. “Harold Hill, are you the one who provoked Brother Theo and Mr. Clarke?” His tone was ice-cold and probing.</p>  <p id = > “This… This is all just a mistake, a mistake,” Harold quickly explained with a bow.</p>  <p id = > However… Slap!</p>  <p id = > Tiger’s expression darkened. He went over and threw a vicious slap across the man’s face, admonishing, “Harold Hill, you’re able to keep working here because I took care of you! Now that your wings have strengthened, you’re off to provoke Brother Theo and Mr. Clarke?”</p>  <p id = > Tiger immediately turned to Theo and said fearfully, “Brother Theo, it was my incompetence that has caused my underlings to offend you. I will take full responsibility for this incident. Don’t worry. This guy is dead!”</p>  <p id = > When he saw Tiger with such a humble attitude, Harold felt like his heart had dropped into a frozen abyss. Jeremy and Darius, who were standing behind him, were like stubbed out explosives. They could only suppress themselves, not daring to breathe another word.</p>  <p id = > Darius was now mentally prepared to die. To think he had just been scolding Theo Zander, the mob king! Oh god! The person he idolized most was Lord Zander, and he even dreamed of becoming the man’s underling! But that was all over now. He had destroyed that possibility with his own hands.</p>  <p id = > Thud! Harold immediately fell to his knees and begged, “Brother Theo, I’m sorry, I was too blind to recognize you, please forgive me this time.</p>  <p id = > But Theo only answered indifferently, “There’s no use apologizing to me. You should apologize to Mr. Clarke.”</p>  <p id = > “Mr. Clarke, Mr. Clarke, please have some compassion and forgive me. I won’t ever do it again.” Harold turned to kneel in front of Philip, crying almost instantly.</p>  <p id = > He was afraid… terrified. Standing before him was Brother Tiger and Lord Zander. With just a stomp of their feet, these people can cause the whole city to quake! His family’s well being was now hanging by a thread.</p>  <p id = > Philip said nothing but glanced at him.</p>  <p id = > Darius, too, was frightened and quickly dropped to his knees, prostrating in apology. Jeremy and his group felt weak in their knees as they trembled in fear.</p>  <p id = > “Forget it, just teach them a lesson or two,” Philip said faintly as he looked at Harold. “You, get the amusement park staff to look for my daughter this instant.”</p>  <p id = > “Yes, yes, at once!” Harold quickly stood up and led his men out.</p>  <p id = > Before he left, Harold gave his son a hard slap across the face. “Grow some brains and stop provoking people. I don’t want to have to clean up your mess every time you cause trouble!”</p>  <p id = > Jeremy dared not retort a single word. He only turned to glance at Philip, still feeling startled. Isn’t this guy Lynn’s cousin brother-in-law? Isn’t he just a piece of trash? How did things turn out like this?</p>                <h2 id =chapter-42 > Chapter 42</h2> <p id = > How was he acquainted with a prominent figure like Theo Zander?</p>  <p id = > “Wait,” Philip suddenly called out.</p>  <p id = > In an instant, the group at the door froze in panic, unsure whether to stay or leave.</p>  <p id = > “Mr. Clarke, do you have any other instructions?” Harold still had a little more guts and could afford to stay composed.</p>  <p id = > “I hope you all will not speak of this incident today with anyone else. I do not wish for my daily life to be disrupted, do you understand?” said Philip.</p>  <p id = > “We understand, we understand.” Harold nodded continuously.</p>  <p id = > Philip then nodded, and the group immediately dispersed, almost running away.</p>  <p id = > After they finally got out, Jeremy took a deep breath. When they reached the entrance, they saw Lynn. Jeremy hesitated for the longest time but chose to stay quiet in the end.</p>  <p id = > “How did it go?” Lynn asked anxiously. To be frank, she was unwilling to watch her wretched cousin brother-in-law punished, so she chose to stay behind at the entrance.</p>  <p id = > Jeremy shook his head and answered, “It was okay.”</p>  <p id = > Okay? Lynn was a little confused. She noticed that her other friend had a heavy look on their faces.</p>  <p id = > “Alright, alright, let’s go for karaoke,” Jeremy suggested. Mainly because the air around them was too dense, and he was afraid that Lynn might notice something was up.</p>  <p id = > When the rest heard this, they quickly snapped back to their senses and forced a smile. “Sure, Brother Jeremy’s treat!” The group of youngsters finally left.</p>  <p id = > On the other hand, Tiger’s men and the amusement park staff found Mila in no time. To be more specific, a young woman around her early twenties had been looking after Mila as they waited at a dessert shop outside the amusement park.</p>  <p id = > “Mr. Clarke, we found her. She’s at Sweetheart Desserts.” Theo jogged over, ignoring the sweat on his forehead to show Philip the way.</p>  <p id = > As they hurried over to the dessert shop, Philip finally saw his daughter eating cake.</p>  <p id = > “Papa!” When little Mila saw Philip, she pounced into his arms, and as she had just experienced great grievance, she hid in her father’s embrace, holding onto his sweat-drenched shirt tightly.</p>  <p id = > “Papa’s here, Mila, don’t be afraid, Papa’s here.” Philip carried his daughter up as he comforted her. At the same time, he looked at that young lady.</p>  <p id = > She was a very beautiful girl, looked to be around her early twenties with straight and long dark hair. She was wearing a simple and clean white T-shirt with a pair of light-colored jeans and tiny white shoes. Her makeup was light, and she looked like a lovely and pure young lady.</p>  <p id = > “Thank you so much.” Philip nodded in gratitude.</p>  <p id = > The girl smiled and got up. “It’s no problem. I saw her crying alone in the amusement part and couldn’t find her parents, so I brought her here.</p>  <p id = > “This little girl is just too adorable, so it’s good that nothing bad happened.” Silvia Hayes tucked a stray hair behind her ear before reaching out to poke Mila’s cheek, smiling sweetly.</p>  <p id = > After she spoke a little with Mila, Philip put her down. The little girl was staring hard at the strawberry cake on the table.</p>  <p id = > “Eat it. I bought it for you.” Silvia pushed the remaining cake to Mila.</p>  <p id = > Mila lifted her head. Tears were sparkling in her big eyes as she looked at Philip as if seeking his opinion.</p>  <p id = > Philip caressed her tiny head and smiled. “Go ahead. Say ‘thank you’ to Big Sister.”</p>  <p id = > “Thank you, Big Sister.” Mila smiled, exposing two adorable dimples before she started eating the cake happily.</p>  <p id = > At the door, Theo, Tiger, and their men were waiting by the road. They did not dare to go inside in fear of scaring the little girl.</p>  <p id = > Philip kept thanking Silvia and got a clearer picture of the situation from her. “Uhm, if you have time at night, please let me treat you to dinner as a token of my appreciation.” This was a nice young lady, very generous and kind.</p>  <p id = > Silvia smiled and said, “There’s no need for the trouble. It’s nothing much.”</p>  <p id = > Since she rejected the offer, Philip did not force her. Just then, he received a call from his father-in-law. Philip apologized before excusing himself to take the call outside. “Dad, what’s up?”</p>  <p id = > “Philip, get back here this instant. I want to speak to you!” On the other end of the call, the older man’s behavior was awful, and he sounded annoyed.</p>  <p id = > After some thought, Philip braced himself and answered, “Okay, I’ll be back soon.”</p>  <p id = > Toot! The call was hung up by the older man, just like that. Philip heaved a sigh, knowing he would not be able to escape tonight.</p>  <p id = > When he turned back into the dessert shop, a shocking incident happened!</p>  <p id = > Out of nowhere, a man appeared, holding a large bouquet of roses, looking to be very handsome and very rich.</p>  <p id = > However, at that moment, Mila was wailing out loud. Her cries then gradually turned into hiccups like she had difficulty breathing.</p>  <p id = > Silvia was squatting down before Mila, comforting her before shooting a vicious glare at the man. She sounded irked when she questioned, “Leon Larson, why did you hit a child?”</p>  <p id = > The man named Leon pouted, looking angrily at his own navy suit. “This wild brat has ruined my suit. I had hit her to educate her on behalf of her parents. This suit costs forty thousand!”</p>  <p id = > Leon was furious. This suit he was wearing was a tailor-made Armani suit worth thirty thousand! He had especially dressed up today to confess to Silvia. But this stupid brat had smudged buttercream on his outfit, so just hitting her was already very nice of him! She might not even be enough to compensate for his suit even if he sold her away.</p>  <p id = > Philip, who was just entering the shop, saw this scene. “What’s wrong, Mila?” He hurried over to the little girl to find a red slap mark on her left cheek!</p>  <p id = > Philip instantly flew into a rage, especially when he heard Mila’s hysterical cries. Philip wanted to stab this arrogant and pompous man in front of him.</p>  <p id = > Philip stood up and glared furiously at the man, saying through gritted teeth, “You, apologize to my daughter, now!”</p>  <p id = > Leon’s lips curved into a smirk. “Are you this brat’s father? Okay, open your filthy eyes wide and look at this. This is a tailor-made Armani suit that costs forty thousand dollars that your daughter has just ruined. If you can compensate for it, I’ll apologize to her.”</p>  <p id = > Leon had already taken a good look at the man in front of him. The man was dressed plainly, and it was easy to tell that he had no money. He had deliberately said forty thousand in an attempt to scare Philip off, make him back down so he could save the hassle.</p>  <p id = > However, Philip’s next words stunned Leon.</p>  <p id = > “Armani? Forty thousand? Okay, I’ll give you four hundred thousand. Apologize to my daughter at once!” Philip said furiously. His face was red, with his fists clenched tight.</p>  <p id = > When Mila smiled, the world would feel like warm springtime.</p>  <p id = > When Mila cried, he would make the world cry with her!</p>  <p id = > Regardless of their status, whoever bullied his daughter would have to pay!</p>              <h2 id =chapter-43 > Chapter 43</h2> <p id = > Leon suddenly started laughing. It was a burst of presumptuous and mocking laughter.</p>  <p id = > “What did you just say? Four hundred thousand? Bro, there should be a limit to your act.” Leon continued to mock, “I think what you’re wearing isn’t even worth three hundred. Oh, right, and with that blind daughter of yours, you two wouldn’t even add up to four digits. Forget four hundred thousand, can you even pay up forty thousand?”</p>  <p id = > It was Leon’s first time meeting such a hilarious person. The man was even a father to a child, what an idiot. He must have just been putting up a front to act cool in front of his kid.</p>  <p id = > “Leon, what are you saying? You were at fault first. Why can’t you just apologize to the child?” Silvia sounded annoyed. She had never expected that Leon would hit such an adorable little girl. This man was too vile! Thankfully, she had not accepted his confession earlier. However, Silvia was worried about Philip because she knew of Leon’s background. The young man was from a rich family. His family owned a business that was worth about two hundred million. Leon had often boasted about driving a Ferrari and living in a mansion to his friends. A typical rich spoiled brat. It would be a pain to provoke him.</p>  <p id = > “Mr. Clarke, I’m sorry. Let me apologize on his behalf. He’s my friend.” Silvia did not hope to cause a scene. She was mainly worried that if Philip and Leon got into a dispute, it would only be unfavorable for Philip and his daughter.</p>  <p id = > However, Philip spoke indifferently, “Thank you for your kind intentions, but he has to apologize to my daughter. I will not repeat this a third time.”</p>  <p id = > “This is killing me! Bro, you’re hilarious. Do you know who I am?” Leon smirked in mockery. He dug out his Gucci wallet from his shirt pocket, took out a few red notes, and scattered it piece by piece in front of Philip. “Here, is this enough? Weren’t you just trying to cheat my money? I know what garbage like you are thinking.”</p>  <p id = > Seeing Philip motionless, Leon continued to take out a few more hundred dollar notes and stuffed it into Philip’s breast-pocket, saying cheekily, “If that wasn’t enough, here’s some more. Just give me a number. Money is all I have.” After that, he glared hatefully at Mila, who was in Silvia’s arms, and mumbled under his breath, “Little b*tch.”</p>  <p id = > Upon hearing this, Philip exploded.</p>  <p id = > “Theo, get in here!” Philip roared.</p>  <p id = > Theo was smoking by the street. When he heard this order, the man scrambled into the shop, looking nothing like the prestigious mob king.</p>  <p id = > “Mr. Clarke, what is it?” Theo asked respectfully.</p>  <p id = > Philip turned to smile at Silvia. “Can I trouble you to carry my daughter outside to wait for a bit while I take care of this?”</p>  <p id = > Silvia frowned a little. She urged in a small voice, “Mr. Clarke, don’t push yourself. If things don’t work out, just forget about it.”</p>  <p id = > Philip nodded. He then scratched lightly at his daughter’s nose and smiled gently. “Mila’s a good girl. Papa will punish the bad guy first and keep you company later, okay?”</p>  <p id = > Mila rubbed her big teary eyes and nodded.</p>  <p id = > After Silvia carried his daughter out, Philip glared at Leon.</p>  <p id = > The latter was nonchalant as he mocked. “Wow, you have even brought in an assistant. Why? Do you still want to lecture me?”</p>  <p id = > Philip put his hands behind him and asked coldly, “Your name is Leon Larson?” In Philip’s mind, he was thinking of making this young man pay dearly.</p>  <p id = > “That’s right. The name’s Leon Larson, the young master of Prime Harvest Group.” Leon introduced himself with a smirk playing on his lips. It was clear that he was trying to oppress Philip.</p>  <p id = > Prime Harvest Group was also very famous within Riverdale City. If a regular person tried to provoke this establishment, it was like throwing eggs at a rock. And evidently, in Leon’s eyes, Philip was that egg.</p>  <p id = > Philip shifted his gaze to Theo and asked in a deep voice, “Do you know them?”</p>  <p id = > Theo quickly answered, “Prime Harvest Group is one of the famous corporations in Riverdale City. They’re worth two hundred million and are focused in the construction materials business. The president, Lewis Larson, had started from a renovation business. They have a few hitmen in their ranks, specially hired to take care of any business disputes.”</p>  <p id = > Theo explained with exceptional knowledge for the company. Prime Harvest Group was truly troublesome to take care of. Although Theo was the mob king, it was sometimes hard for him to take care of the ones above ground. Especially for a corporation like this that would easily cost about hundreds of millions to influence, even he had to tread carefully. Although everyone would still show him respect, if they really butt heads, neither side would profit anything.</p>  <p id = > Hence, Theo leaned closer to whisper into Philip’s ear, “Mr. Clarke, this Prime Harvest Group will be very tricky. The old man, Lewis Larson, is also a man of power.”</p>  <p id = > Philip frowned, not saying anything. It looked like Theo was only dominant in appearances. If Theo knew that Philip saw him that way, the man might probably hate him for being a coward.</p>  <p id = > Leon could not help but smile. “What? You think that just because you can recite what my family does that I’d be afraid of you? With just a little research, anybody can know about this.” What were they trying to do? Trying to scare him? Leon might just go mad from laughing too much. Were these two idiots?</p>  <p id = > However, Philip spoke up calmly, “Theo, I won’t trouble you with this, so you don’t have to interfere. I’ll deal with this myself.”</p>  <p id = > Theo breathed a quiet sigh of relief. To be honest, having him go against Prime Harvest Group was like asking him to negotiate with a tiger if they could skin it alive. There would be no positive outcome. Nonetheless, Theo added for the sake of it, “Why don’t I contact Lewis to come over and apologize to you? He should be able to show me at least that much respect.”</p>  <p id = > “No need. He, Leon Larson, has to be dealt with today. If his old man ends up bringing more trouble instead, he’d have to be dealt with as well.” Philip lifted his head and snorted. “I want Prime Harvest Group to disappear from Riverdale City completely!”</p>  <p id = > Disappear completely? Theo was stunned! He was completely baffled. Although he knew that Mr. Clarke had a special identity, making a company worth hundreds of millions disappear entirely with just a few words sounded like a joke.</p>  <p id = > Lewis Larson was a man of status in Riverdale City. He was also acquainted with some very influential people. Even a powerful man like Theo Zander would be unwilling to clash with Lewis Larson of Prime Harvest Group because it was not worth it.</p>  <p id = > It was not to say that Theo was not capable. Just that if he were to weigh the pros and cons, he would, of course, choose the more advantageous route.</p>  <p id = > Not bothering with any more nonsense, Philip took out his phone and called a number.</p>                 <h2 id =chapter-44 > Chapter 44</h2> <p id = > It was George Thomas’s number.</p>  <p id = > Almost instantly, the call was answered, and from the other end came George’s voice, “Young Master, what are your instructions?”</p>  <p id = > “Investigate Prime Harvest Group. I want them bankrupt in ten minutes!” said Philip faintly.</p>  <p id = > “That’s a small matter,” George answered easily, but then he quickly said, “Young Master, this Prime Harvest Group seems to be doing well, so I’d suggest that you buy it instead. It’s not very expensive too. Their worth on the market now would be… three hundred million. You just have to spend three hundred million to buy them over.”</p>  <p id = > George’s suggestion sounded really good. If he had to destroy a corporation, why not buy it over instead and own it? That way, no one would lose their jobs, and it would be good to keep the market stable.</p>  <p id = > “Alright then, buy it over. Have Lewis Larson come to the dessert shop opposite of Millennium Amusement Park this instant,” said Philip calmly. “One other thing, I want you to send three hundred million in cash, by car to the dessert shop.” When he said this, Philip glanced coldly at Leon.</p>  <p id = > “Young Master, it would be tough to get three hundred million cash in such a short amount of time,” said George.</p>  <p id = > “How long will you need?”</p>  <p id = > “Half an hour.”</p>  <p id = > “No, send it over in fifteen minutes. If you can’t do that, I won’t inherit the family business,” said Philip, and he hung up immediately after that.</p>  <p id = > In the now quiet dessert shop, a burst of mad laughter rang all of a sudden.</p>  <p id = > Leon was trembling from laughing too much as he stared at Philip with a mocking expression. “You’re really an idiot. Are you trying to be an actor? Are you going to buy my company with three hundred million dollars in cash? Can you be any funnier?”</p>  <p id = > Leon gave up. This guy did not make sense. Did he know what three hundred million dollars in cash were? Did he know what complicated procedures it would require to cash out three hundred million dollars? And he wanted it in fifteen minutes. Bullsh*t! He could not even pick out a better excuse when acting.</p>  <p id = > “It’s not your fault that you’re poor. But it’s a mistake for acting in front of me.” Leon chuckled freely. “Have you ever seen money? Did you know that you have to make a reservation in advance, even for three million cash? You must have gone mad from being so poor!”</p>  <p id = > However, Philip only quietly looked at Leon, not saying a word. This brat was really arrogant. Philip was wondering what his reaction would be like when he saw the money later.</p>  <p id = > Leon wanted to leave. Today, his goal was to confess to Silvia, so he had no time for any nonsense with an idiot.</p>  <p id = > However, Theo’s sturdy build was standing at the door, blocking his way out.</p>  <p id = > “Okay, I’ll just see for myself if you can get that three hundred million cash.”</p>  <p id = > Leon was annoyed. He plopped down on the sofa, crossed his legs, and opened up the streaming application on his phone to do a live stream. “Brothers, I’m doing a live stream now about meeting a lunatic who says he wants to buy my company.” His screen was then filled with popped up comments that read: Awesome!</p>  <p id = > “Here, I’ll show you guys that idiot who even said he wants to buy my company with three hundred million cash. I’m waiting here right now to see if this broke rascal can bring over the money,” Leon taunted with a cold smirk. “If you guys like this, remember to hit the subscribe button.”</p>  <p id = > As Leon streamed, his audience in the live room went into an uproar.</p>  <p id = > “That’s too cool, bro! I’ve never seen three hundred million in cash. Can’t wait!”</p>  <p id = > As he watched the comments popping up on the screen, Leon’s smirk deepened. He usually liked to stream about dating girls in his car and similar content, and those were very well-received. Today, it was his first time streaming about someone with an egg on his face, and Leon was ecstatic. How exhilarating! A live stream about someone with an egg on his face! Leon was blooming on the inside, thinking that his fame as a streamer was about to rise. To prove his point, his die-hard fans started sending him virtual gifts.</p>  <p id = > “Thank you, FreckledOlivia, Fred_Cannon, and SkinnyKimmyNo3 for the gifts, but you guys don’t actually have to give me anything. I don’t lack money.” Leon laughed cheekily as he glanced at Philip, feeling contempt for the man.</p>  <p id = > At the same time, outside the dessert store, a long row of armored cars drove over slowly and abruptly stopped in front of the door! From a distance, there seemed to be more than ten cars!</p>  <p id = > This scene immediately stunned everyone on the streets! These were f*cking armored cash carriers… And more than ten cars at that! Why did they stop in front of a dessert shop? Moreover, four SWAT polices in their uniforms, carrying loaded guns, had come out from each of these armored cars, standing ready at the side! They all looked stern and dignified, exuding a cold, murderous aura. In an instant, they had blocked off five meters around the area, not allowing anyone to enter that range!</p>  <p id = > “Holy sh*t! What’s happening? There are armored cars and SWAT police.”</p>  <p id = > “Oh dear, what happened?”</p>  <p id = > “There are around thirty cars. If each car carried ten million, wouldn’t there be at least three hundred million in cash here?”</p>  <p id = > The crowd went into an uproar. Many people were taking photos and sharing them on their social media.</p>  <p id = > How shocking! It was a rare scene in the country! And this scene was also noticed by Leon, who was inside the dessert shop. His phone had been streaming it the whole time.</p>  <p id = > In an instant, his live room went viral! His fame rate had shot up to millions in popularity!</p>  <p id = > Just what the f*ck is going on? Leon was dumbstruck. His whole body was shaking, but his final ounce of willfulness had supported him as he stood up to stare, shocked, at Philip as he asked in disbelief, “Are you the one who called these armored cars over?”</p>      <h2 id =chapter-45 > Chapter 45</h2> <p id = > Leon’s mind was now like a roller-coaster, in complete chaos.</p>  <p id = > My name is Leon Larson, and I am now in a state of panic! There are thirty armored cash carriers outside the door, waiting in a line. Beside each car are four SWAT officers carrying loaded guns. They’re all wearing black battle uniforms, black helmets, and carrying black guns. Yes, it’s not the regular armored car escorts who carry rubber bullets. These are real bullets. Because the sum was too huge, the bank has contacted the SWAT team urgently, and they have sent more than a hundred SWAT officers over to escort the money. This was all done in less than ten minutes.</p>  <p id = > Philip calmly looked at Leon whose forehead was now covered in sweat and said, “I called them here.”</p>  <p id = > Boom! Leon felt his mind explode. His hands kept shaking. He was from a wealthy family and knew full well how terrifying a person is to send over so much cash in such a short time! His scalp felt prickly as he experienced despair for the first time. However, he was reluctant to give in.</p>  <p id = > “Impossible, there’s no way! There’s no way that you’re the one who called them!” Leon could barely stand still. He took his phone to call his father frantically. Find Dad, Dad can definitely solve this!</p>  <p id = > However, before he even spoke, furious yells flowed from the other end of the call, “Stupid brat, have you gone insane? Who did you provoke?” Lewis was currently going mad with anger at the president’s office of his own company. Not too far from him stood an old man in a swallow-tail coat, holding a gold and black walking stick, wearing a calm expression.</p>  <p id = > George Thomas had personally come to Prime Harvest Group.</p>  <p id = > After Lewis roared a few more times into the phone, he ended the call and smiled flatteringly at George. “President Thomas, I’m so sorry. My son has caused trouble. I will personally go and apologize to Master Clarke now.”</p>  <p id = > George shook his head. The tall female secretary beside him immediately handed Lewis a corporate acquisition contract. “Mr. Larson, our young master plans to acquire your business. This is the agreement with the buying price of three hundred million. Please sign it,” George said indifferently. His tone did not sound like it was a negotiation, but an order.</p>  <p id = > Lewis’s heart shuddered. Clenching his fists tight, he forced out a smile and asked, “President Thomas, do I need to? Why don’t I personally apologize to Young Master Clarke?” This company was Lewis’s life. While it was true that his company was worth three hundred million, but if he handed it away so suddenly, how would Lewis ever keep his status in Riverdale City? He had a very ambitious goal, which was to enter the national market.</p>  <p id = > “Lewis Larson, this is not a negotiation. It’s my young master’s intention. Please sign it.” George maintained an indifferent attitude. His eyes were narrowed with a barely visible glint.</p>  <p id = > Lewis’s back was drenched in a cold sweat. With gritted teeth, he held up the pen with much difficulty as he signed his name on the agreement.</p>  <p id = > Could he have refused to sign it? This man before him was George Thomas, the wealthiest man in Riverdale, worth more than tens of billions! If his young master wanted to acquire his company, how would he dare to refuse? If he ever dared to, what awaited him would definitely be a devastating blow. Moreover, his company’s growth was all thanks to President Thomas’s investment and support during its early days.</p>  <p id = > After signing his name, Lewis felt the energy leave his body all at once as he sat, powerlessly onto the sofa.</p>  <p id = > George smiled and said, “Lewis Larson, you really do have a clear view of things. Now, please come with me.”</p>  <p id = > Lewis nodded. The moment he stood up, it was like he had grown ten years older. That shrewd spark seemed to have disappeared from his muddled eyes. He now resented that good-for-nothing son of his.</p>  <p id = > Back to Philip and Leon. After Leon’s father had admonished him, he was dumbstruck, completely at a loss of what he should do next. The crowd of onlookers outside was getting bigger and bigger as they chattered among themselves. The live room on his phone was a hit. Its popularity had now crossed over millions! The screen was filled with popped up comments like, ‘tycoon’, ‘awesome’, ‘god of fortune, please let me pray to you’ and etcetera. Thirty armored cash carriers were such a spectacular display none of them had ever seen before in their lives!</p>  <p id = > “Leon, I’ve told you before that you have to apologize to my daughter today,” Philip said coldly. “Now, I’m giving you a choice. Either you go outside now and apologize to my daughter in front of everyone, or slap yourself ten times.”</p>  <p id = > Hehehe! Leon laughed. It was a hysterical laugh. He was from a rich family. He was the young master of Prime Harvest Group! Of course, he had his pride! “You want me to apologize to that b*tch? Dream on! So what if you have money? It’s not like you can force me to sell the company!” Leon gave a frightening smirk. He held the phone up, pointing the camera at Philip and said, “Everyone, take a good look, this is him! If anything happens to me, make a police report on my behalf!”</p>  <p id = > A police report? Bam! Philip went over and kicked Leon hard in the stomach, making the boy fall flat on his face. He then snatched the phone from Leon’s hand, stared straight at the camera, and adjusted the clarity, curving his lips slightly. Philip said politely, “Everyone in this live stream room, hello. My name is Philip Clarke, Mila Clarke’s father. My three-year-old daughter had accidentally gotten cake on this young master of Prime Harvest Group, and he slapped her. As a father, I can’t tolerate my daughter being bullied. So, I have decided to spend three hundred million dollars to acquire Prime Harvest Group to make this young master here, who was looking down at my daughter and me, apologize to my daughter.”</p>  <p id = > It was only a simple statement, but that live room instantly went into a great uproar.</p>  <p id = > The man had actually spent three hundred million to buy a company!</p>  <p id = > “Daddy, are you looking for another kid, Daddy? I can be your son.”</p>  <p id = > “Hey, the commenter above me, you’re my little brother, call me ‘Older Brother’!”</p>  <p id = > In an instant, the atmosphere of the live chat room changed, and everyone started attacking Leon while many people cheered for Philip.</p>          <h2 id =chapter-46 > Chapter 46</h2> <p id = > A father should be willing to risk it all for his child. In their words, if they had three hundred million, they would definitely smash the money, stack by stack at Leon until he apologized.</p>  <p id = > Leon was utterly flustered as he struggled to get up. Philip had already ended the live stream.</p>  <p id = > Theo clenched his fists tight and closed in, step by step. With a swift movement, he pushed Leon against the wall and growled, “Brat, I’d advise you to hurry outside and apologize to Mr. Clarke’s daughter, or else you won’t be able to see tomorrow’s sunlight.”</p>  <p id = > Being disrespectful to Mr. Clarke’s daughter meant being disrespectful to his princess! That was right! In Theo’s eyes, Philip’s daughter was a little princess!</p>  <p id = > Leon struggled as he started yelling, “How dare you! My father is Lewis Larson! So what if you have money? Can you just buy my company as you please? Dream on! If I say ‘no’, who would dare to sell it?!” Leon had thought it through. The man was only rich, but his father was an influential man in society. They even have a bunch of hitmen at home. If they were to really go down, he believed that Philip, too, would have to pay a little price.</p>  <p id = > However, while Leon was struggling and shouting, a few people rushed in through the door.</p>  <p id = > George walked over respectfully to Philip, took off his hat, and greeted, “Young Master, the money is here, and I’ve brought him too.”</p>  <p id = > Philip nodded faintly.</p>  <p id = > As Lewis, who was following behind George, saw this scene. He was stunned beyond words. So this was President Thomas’s young master! The man sure had an extraordinary aura.</p>  <p id = > Lewis strode into the premise, went over indignantly, and gave Leon two slaps across the face. “Stupid rascal! I’m in trouble because of you! Get outside and apologize to Young Master Clarke!”</p>  <p id = > Leon was dumbfounded as he stared at his father, who was scolding him. In an instant, he thundered, “Dad, why are you afraid of them? They just have a little more money, so what? If we don’t sell our company, what can they do?”</p>  <p id = > However… Lewis directly kicked the boy a few times. He was so livid with anger. “I’ve already sold the company! Hurry up and apologize to Mr. Clarke!”</p>  <p id = > “What? You sold it?” Leon exclaimed, his eyes were filled with shock. His father sold the company? Had he gone mad?</p>  <p id = > Lewis had no time for this idiotic son of his. He personally went over to Philip and bowed to apologize. “Young Master Clarke, I’m sorry, it’s my fault for not educating him properly. If you want to punish someone, please punish me.”</p>  <p id = > Philip looked at Lewis and shook his head. “That won’t do. He has to apologize to my daughter. And ten slaps. To himself!”</p>  <p id = > Since Philip had said so, Lewis knew what to do. He personally dragged Leon outside to Silvia and little Mila, who was waiting inside Theo’s car.</p>  <p id = > When Silvia saw Lewis, she immediately covered her hands over her mouth and screamed. It was Prime Harvest Group’s president, Leon’s father! The figure who was worth two hundred million!</p>  <p id = > However, the next scene stunned Silvia so much. She could barely regain her sense.</p>  <p id = > “I’m sorry,” Lewis and Leon were standing outside the door, bowing as they apologized to little Mila, who was inside the car.</p>  <p id = > “Now, do it!” Lewis roared at Leon. “If you won’t do it, I’ll do it for you!”</p>  <p id = > Next, Leon had very reluctantly started slapping himself in the face! That sound was crisp and loud.</p>  <p id = > This scared Mila, and she quickly hid inside Silvia’s arms. Because the door was closed and the curtains had been put down, Silvia had no idea what just happened outside. As she watched Leon slap himself, she was very confused and shocked.</p>  <p id = > A little while later, Philip came over. After speaking a little with Silvia, he pecked Mila gently and caressed her tiny head. “Mila, Papa has already taught the bad guy who bullied you a lesson. No one can ever bully you anymore.” After that, he closed the door once again.</p>  <p id = > Perhaps it might shock his daughter, but he had to do it! He wanted to tell his daughter that whoever bullied her would be set straight by her father!</p>  <p id = > Once they returned to the dessert shop, Lewis and Leon stood before Philip, not daring to utter a word. Especially Leon, who was now looking deathly pale with his cheeks swollen. However, he was feeling extremely reluctant on the inside. Since it’s sold, forget about it. At least the money’s still here.</p>  <p id = > Yet, in the next second, Philip asked, “Lewis, do you dare to take the three hundred million that I have brought over?”</p>            <h2 id =chapter-47 > Chapter 47</h2> <p id = > Leon lifted his head to look at Philip with a bit of anger and apprehension. “Why wouldn’t we dare to? Since you’ve bought our company, this money belongs to us!”</p>  <p id = > The boy was reluctant to give in after all.</p>  <p id = > Philip smirked. Lewis turned around and gave his son another slap. “Shut up!”</p>  <p id = > Leon was stunned. In all of his life, today was the first time his father had slapped him so many times. He was just about to retort, but Lewis bowed and said humbly, “If Young Master Clarke wants my company, then it will be a gift to Young Master Clarke. Of course, I won’t take the money.”</p>  <p id = > Lewis was not an idiot. He knew that only this way, he and his son would be able to survive.</p>  <p id = > Philip nodded and glanced at George. The latter had the armored cars driven majestically away from the door. Yes, just like that, in front of Leon’s eyes, the cars drove away, one by one. That was three hundred million, all of Larson’s family’s assets!</p>  <p id = > “Dad, what are you doing? That’s the Larson family’s money!” Leon roared and glared venomously at Philip at the same time.</p>  <p id = > Yet, Lewis admonished him, saying, “What do you know?! What do you mean by the Larson family’s money? Those are all Young Master Clarke’s money! Our business could grow only because of President Thomas’s investment. If he wants to buy it, we have to give it!” President Thomas’s investment was naturally Young Master Clarke’s investment.</p>  <p id = > President Thomas? At this, Leon finally noticed that the old man standing beside Philip was none other than the wealthiest man in Riverdale City! The legendary rich man! And on Philip’s left side, standing a little further behind was a middle-aged man who looked very familiar.</p>  <p id = > Theo… Theo Zander, Brother Theo?! Leon was baffled. No wonder he thought the man looked familiar from the start. But it was too late for regrets now.</p>  <p id = > A few minutes later, Lewis and Leon were standing at the door of the dessert shop, bowing as they saw Philip and his group out. Until Philip and his people were out of sight, like his spine had been ripped out, Leon fell to the ground, paralyzed. He started mumbling as tears fell, “It’s over; everything’s over.” A rich kid whose family assets were worth millions became average in just a blink of an eye. This was Philip’s approach and rage. Without spending a single cent, he had just changed the ownership of Prime Harvest Group.</p>  <p id = > Meanwhile, after a day of twists and turns, Philip could finally take a breather. After carrying his daughter out, Philip had Theo send Silvia home safely. And just like that, Silvia was sent home by Theo with a stomach full of questions.</p>  <p id = > Standing at the door of the old house, Philip was carrying Mila as he scratched her nose. After a laugh, he knocked on the door and called out, “Dad, Mom, I’m home.”</p>  <p id = > He waited for a brief moment. Clack! The door opened to show Martha with a straight face, staring at Philip and Mila with disdain. She rolled her eyes and said, “What are you yelling for? You have even brought this stupid brat back, what bad luck!”</p>  <p id = > Philip gave her a helpless and bitter laugh. Mila was leaning onto Philip’s shoulder, pouting aggrievedly.</p>  <p id = > Upon entering the door, Philip saw Wynn and his father-in-law sitting in the living room. The older man seemed to be very furious.</p>  <p id = > “Why did you come back?” Philip frowned at Wynn. She should be at the hospital, why was she discharged?</p>  <p id = > Slap! The old man slammed hard on the table. With a vicious look on his face, he said, “Philip, let’s be frank today. You and Wynn better hurry to the Civil Affairs Bureau and get a divorce.”</p>  <p id = > Divorce? Wynn was stunned, and Philip was dumbstruck. This was too sudden!</p>  <p id = > “Dad, what are you saying? I won’t divorce Philip. This will never happen.” Wynn immediately refused. She reached out to carry Mila from Philip.</p>  <p id = > Philip was about to sit down when the older woman yelled, “Stand up! Is there any place for you here to sit? A slacker who does nothing all day and is good-for-nothing. Did you embarrass your dad today? Now your dad, my old friends, and colleagues all know about it. You have utterly embarrassed both of us!”</p>  <p id = > Philip was confused. Wynn frowned at him and asked, “What's going on? Did you make mom and dad angry again?” Why can’t you just cause less trouble?</p>  <p id = > Philip stood helplessly and explained, “I didn’t. I just took the wrong painting, but things have been resolved.”</p>  <p id = > “Hmph!” The old man snorted. “Resolved? Thanks to you, my friends are now laughing at me. I’ve been collecting art for half of my life, but I have to rely on a wretched and useless son-in-law who randomly bought a painting from an antique market to save face.” At the mention of this, Charles was boiling with anger again. Although Philip’s painting was authentic, he still had to endure the gossip by his old pals.</p>  <p id = > Wynn was puzzled, so after some clarification, she said, “Dad, you can’t blame Philip for this. Aiden gave you a fake painting, but you didn’t find faults with him. So, why are you scolding Philip instead?” Wynn felt helpless. Her parents were just too unreasonable. She knew that her parents dislike Philip because of that incident back then, but that was so many years ago. Why could they not let it go?</p>  <p id = > Martha scornfully reproached, “Wynnie, are you helping the outsider now? Your dad and I have raised you with so much difficulty, and what kind of son-in-law did you bring home to us? I’ll be straightforward and say that you and Philip have to divorce no matter what. Or else, I’ll disown you!”</p>  <p id = > Disown her? Those words were just too cruel.</p>  <p id = > Wynn instantly lost patience. She got up with Mila in her arms and said, “Mom, Dad, since you’re frank, I’ll be frank as well. I will never divorce Philip. You guys can just do whatever you want.” Having said, Wynn walked out of the door in her high heels. At the same time, she turned and roared at Philip, “What are you still standing there for? We’re going home!”</p>  <p id = > However, Philip stood motionless at the living room, seeming to be lost in thought. “Mom, Dad, I know that you guys are looking down on me, but I'll show you that I, Philip Clarke, am not weaker than anybody else. I will give Wynn and my daughter a good future, so about your request for us to divorce, I, too, refuse.” Philip then turned to follow Wynn out the door.</p>  <p id = > In the living room, Martha was freaking out from anger. She pointed at the door and yelled like a shrew, “Charles Johnston, look at that! That’s your daughter! And that trash, Philip, even dares to say he’ll show us how great he is! They have to divorce. Otherwise, our family shouldn’t go to my father’s seventieth birthday next week!”</p>  <p id = > Charles felt helpless, as well. He wanted to say something, but Martha made a face, took her bag, and walked out of the door. She had a date with a few of her best friends today to look at some investment plans.</p>                <h2 id =chapter-48 > Chapter 48</h2> <p id = > After Martha left, she went to the park to meet up with her friends. Upon meeting her friends, they started asking about each other. When they came to the topic about their sons-in-law or daughters-in-law, everyone became enthusiastic because their sons-in-law were doing well, and their daughters-in-law were filial. Only Martha kept quiet while she smiled dryly.</p>  <p id = > “Hey, Martha, how is your son-in-law, Philip, lately? I heard he’s making deliveries.” A flamboyantly dressed middle-aged woman suddenly ruthlessly exposed Martha. Because every time they met, they were sure to talk about Martha’s son-in-law. It had already become the norm.</p>  <p id = > “Oh, Martha, why is your son-in-law so terrible? Why don’t you get your daughter to divorce him as soon as possible?”</p>  <p id = > “That won’t do. If they divorced, it would be a second marriage if she remarries. No one would want her. She even has extra baggage, men nowadays don’t like single mothers.”</p>  <p id = > “That’s true. Who would want to raise other people’s children?”</p>  <p id = > The women’s comments were harsh. On the surface, they seemed to be thinking of her daughter, but underneath, they were probably enjoying her misfortune.</p>  <p id = > Martha gritted her teeth in anger, feeling utterly embarrassed. She forced out a smile and said, “I will definitely force my daughter to divorce that trash of a son-in-law! At most, I’ll just have to take care of her for the rest of my life.”</p>  <p id = > Everyone noticed the dark expression on Martha’s face, so they stopped talking about it and changed the subjects until they reached the finance company.</p>  <p id = > ***</p>  <p id = > On the other hand, due to the live stream, Philip’s incident had gone viral. However, in an instant, every media that reported this incident soon deleted their content. Even the videos were gone. It was like a rock that fell into the lake. It was unheard of again.</p>  <p id = > Inside a beauty salon, Ruby Ford made plans with a few of her friends for a spa treatment.</p>  <p id = > Ten minutes earlier, her friend, Helen Bennett, wearing a short white robe with her hair up in a towel and a mask on her face, strutted over and said, “Girls, I found a really huge tycoon!”</p>  <p id = > “What tycoon?” Ruby was lying on her back, enjoying the massage services as she asked without even opening her eyes.</p>  <p id = > “Three hundred million! This guy spent three hundred million to acquire our city’s Prime Harvest Group!” Helen exclaimed, her eyes were filled with envy and excitement. “You guys all know that rich young master, Leon Larson, right? It’s his company that was bought over by this tycoon.”</p>  <p id = > At the mention of three hundred million and Leon, the girls quickly sat up and scrambled to take a look at Helen’s phone. It was only a short clip, and Helen had downloaded it with much difficulty from a social media site. The video quality was blurry, and it was also watermarked.</p>  <p id = > “Isn’t this tycoon so awesome? That was the Young Master Larson from Prime Harvest Group.”</p>  <p id = > “Who’s that? Do you guys know him? Ask him out to meet us.”</p>  <p id = > “I don’t know. He doesn’t seem familiar.”</p>  <p id = > The girls were all snatching the phone, trying to get a better look at the man’s face. Three hundred million, how rich must he be! When Ruby saw the video, she frowned hard. She felt that the silhouette in the video looked very familiar. Philip Clarke? No, impossible! That guy was so broke he even borrowed money from Howard.</p>  <p id = > Ruby did not think much of it and continued to discuss the man who had just spent three hundred million. He was a father too! How manly!</p>  <p id = > Back to Philip. Wynn was walking ahead of Philip with Mila in her arms while he followed behind. They kept walking in silence until the gates of the housing area.</p>  <p id = > Suddenly, Wynn stopped. Mila had already fallen asleep in her arms. Wynn turned back to look at Philip and said, “That incident earlier today, thank you.”</p>  <p id = > Earlier today? Oh, that incident in Celestial Club. Philip said solemnly, “Wynn, you’re my wife. If anything happens next time, you have to tell me in advance.”</p>  <p id = > Wynn nodded in understanding. When she woke up from the hospital, she knew that it was Philip who had saved her. But she did not know how he did it. She had planned to ask him tomorrow because she knew that Gavin and Jeffrey were not easy to deal with. With just her husband’s status, he might not have been able to make it. So, Wynn though that someone else must have helped him. Or perhaps, helped her. Could it be that person who had helped her secure that one million dollar contract with Victory Pharmaceuticals back then? Just who exactly was he?</p>  <p id = > The whole night went on in silence.</p>  <p id = > Early the next morning, Wynn went to work. Philip pretended to be packing up, then he carried Mila, ready to go out. He had just taken one step out of the house when his mother-in-law called. When he answered, from the other end came Martha’s exasperated voice, saying, “Philip, hurry over to Rivercross Street in ten minutes!”</p>  <p id = > Before he could ask for the reason, the call ended. What was the urgent matter that made her sound so anxious? But Philip was already used to it. He looked at Mila and decided to send her to the company to get Agnes to look after her for a bit. After that, he hastily hailed a cab from the office to go to Rivercross Street.</p>  <p id = > The moment he got out, he saw a large group of middle-aged men and women surrounding the tightly closed doors of a finance company as they argued heatedly with a few men and women in suits.</p>  <p id = > “What were you doing? You’re late for five minutes! Growing cheek are you? Just blatantly trying to disrespect your mother-in-law!” Philip had just reached when Martha came over haughtily and started scolding him.</p>               <h2 id =chapter-49 > Chapter 49</h2> <p id = > Philip smiled sheepishly and asked, “Mom, what’s the urgency?”</p>  <p id = > Martha glared at him. “Stay here to add to our numbers, pretend to protest. You don’t have to care about anything else.” Then, Martha and a few other middle-aged men and women went to join the protest, screaming their lungs out. It was a shocking sight.</p>  <p id = > Philip got some info from the bystanders and understood a bit of the situation. This was a financial investment company, and this group of older people had purchased some investment plans here. They were supposed to get their returns today. However, the building was now empty, with only a few lower-level staff left and one manager. By the look of things, that was probably an illegal fund-raising scheme!</p>  <p id = > Here was where the problem got serious. Companies like this usually targeted well-off middle-aged people, and once something took a downturn, they would run away, and the money would be gone. It was no wonder Martha was so anxious.</p>  <p id = > Philip felt a headache coming. He went over and asked, “Mom, what did you buy? How much did you invest?” If it was only a small amount, Philip was not too worried. He was just afraid that his mother-in-law had invested a huge amount.</p>  <p id = > Martha’s voice was almost gone from all the screaming. She glared at Philip but told him nonetheless, “I invested with that house your father and I live in. They said that the house was good for retirement and could rake in huge returns. If we invested this year, we could have two houses next year.”</p>  <p id = > “What? Mom, you invested with the house?” Philip shouted. He knew that it was over this time. His mother-in-law was a retired university instructor, so how could she be so muddled?</p>  <p id = > When Martha heard Philip’s exclamation, her face instantly went red, and she went up and hit his head. “What are you shouting for? Don’t you think it’s already embarrassing enough? If it weren’t for you being useless, would I have had to put the house up for investment? I’m just trying to ensure a better life for the future. Or what, should we rely on trash like you to take care of your father and me?”</p>  <p id = > As Martha scolded, she felt panicked inside. That was the house she had with her husband. If the company had really run off with her money, they would lose the house. How could she not be anxious? Especially at a time like this when Philip still had a nonchalant look on his face, which made her even more furious.</p>  <p id = > “Don’t you tell Wynnie about this. Just stay here and shout. I’m calling Addy over. He should have a solution.” Martha gave Philip a warning glare before she turned to give Aiden a call.</p>  <p id = > “Hello, Addy. It’s me, your Aunt Martha. Are you free right now? Can you come over to Rivercross Street? Yes, yes, there’s something urgent.”</p>  <p id = > Martha’s flattering tone right now made Philip a little annoyed. He was her son-in-law, but she did not treat him as kindly as she did an outsider. But he could not blame her, because, in her eyes, he was trash.</p>  <p id = > When the call ended, Martha was smiling happily. She then rolled her eyes at Philip and scolded, “What are you, a piece of rock? Start shouting!”</p>  <p id = > Philip grunted a reply and then mimicked the group of older people as he shouted hysterically. Upon seeing Philip this hardworking, Martha finally felt better. But she still looked down on him as she mumbled, “Good-for-nothing brat.”</p>  <p id = > After that, Martha went over to her friends to announce cheekily, “Don’t worry, I’ve called our Addy, and he’ll be over in a bit.”</p>  <p id = > “You mean Aiden Grant? Oh my, he’s a really good boy. His family owns a business, so he must have great connections. I heard they earn tens of millions a year.”</p>  <p id = > “Martha, look at us, we’re all old folks. When Aiden gets here later, can you get him to take a look for us as well?”</p>  <p id = > Martha’s friends started fawning over her. This pleased Martha. “Oh yes, Aiden is a really good kid, but we have to see if our Wynnie wants to marry him. After all, there’s still that useless Philip.” Martha chuckled. She did not mind belittling Philip to raise her daughter and Aiden to a higher status.</p>  <p id = > In Martha’s eyes, Aiden was a rich son-in-law, her future treasure vault. Comparing Philip to him was like comparing mud to gold.</p>     <h2 id =chapter-50 > Chapter 50</h2> <p id = > By then, Martha’s friends had noticed Philip. They snorted out and mocked, “Martha, is that your son-in-law? He looks really plain and so absentminded, like a blockhead. Your daughter is so pretty, she must have been blind to marry him!”</p>  <p id = > “Yeah, such a useless man is a disgrace to us elders. Thankfully my son-in-law is not like him.”</p>  <p id = > The group of elders started laughing in mockery.</p>  <p id = > Martha’s cheeky smile earlier was now completely gone. She snorted. “That wretched piece of trash is not my son-in-law. In a few days, I’ll have my daughter divorce him!”</p>  <p id = > Philip had heard the insults directed to him by the group. He could only shake his head and smiled coldly. He was already used to insults like this. They called him a wretched piece of trash, but what were they doing here? They had even called Aiden to come over and help. Now Philip really wanted to see just how Aiden can help with this situation.</p>  <p id = > Just then, a white Maserati drove over on the street, looking very flashy.</p>  <p id = > Martha squealed in delight. “Addy, Aunty’s over here. Look, our Aiden is here. We can solve this now.” Martha emphasized on the word ‘our’, as if afraid that others would not know.</p>  <p id = > Philip pouted, feeling a little suffocated on the inside.</p>  <p id = > The crowd looked toward the sound source to see a handsome young man wearing an expensive suit coming out from the Maserati.</p>  <p id = > Martha went over with an expression like she was looking at her son and smiled. “Addy, you’re finally here. Was it a bother?”</p>  <p id = > After Aiden got out, he politely greeted Martha, “Aunt Martha, it’s alright. I just happen to be free today. What’s the situation here? Has something bad happened?”</p>  <p id = > After a glance around, Aiden noticed Philip, who was shouting hysterically in the crowd. Aiden’s expression immediately fell, and he glared hatefully at Philip. What was that trash doing here?</p>  <p id = > “Addy, something bad happened. My friends and I have purchased a financial plan from this company, and they’ve said that they would pay out the interest today. But when we came here this morning, the boss has gone missing. Can you tell us what’s going on?” Martha clapped her hands together anxiously and seemed to have thought of something. She asked, “Addy, you own a company, so you must know some people. Can you help me find the owner of this company and find out what’s going on?”</p>  <p id = > After taking a look at the situation and listening to Martha’s explanation, Aiden roughly understood. This group of older people had definitely been scammed. It would not be easy to help them.</p>  <p id = > However, when he saw Martha’s earnest gaze and Philip’s expression, which looked like he wanted to laugh, Aiden steeled himself and said confidently with a smile, “Aunt Martha, don’t worry, I can take care of this. I just happened to be acquainted with the boss of this company. I’ll ask him what’s going. You can relax.”</p>  <p id = > “Okay, okay.” Martha was excited. She wore a bright smile and tugged at Aiden’s arm. “Addy’s still the best after all. Better than some wretched trash.”</p>  <p id = > Her friends were now fawning over Aiden, praising him for his capabilities. Aiden’s heart was blooming. He smiled and looked at the signboard of the financial company, feeling very pleased with himself. He knew that today was his day to shine. After he had lost his favor with his future father-in-law, he would now get it back from his future mother-in-law. If he could have Martha on his side, that meant Wynn was already partially his.</p>  <p id = > After that, he shot an arrogant glance at Philip before taking out his phone to call his father. “Dad, didn’t you say that you’ve dined with the boss of Lucrative Funds Finance Company before? I have something that I need your help with…”</p>  <p id = > After the call, Aiden smiled widely as he looked at the older folks, enjoying how everyone had their eyes on him. He cleared his throat and said, “Don’t worry, everyone, my dad knows the boss of this finance company. I’ve already given my dad a call, so I’m sure there will be answers too. Everyone, please don’t worry too much.”</p>  <p id = > The crowd of older folks started praising Aiden. The man felt like he was about to float. Aiden shifted his gaze over to the few staff of the finance company who had stayed behind. “Let me talk to them. Uncles and Aunts, please wait for my good news.” Having said, Aiden walked over proudly to the few staff members, hoping to look almighty.</p>  <p id = > However, a small voice from beside rang in his ears all of a sudden. “Mom, that won’t do. Aiden has tricked you. Why don’t I make a call, maybe it can help…” Philip’s voice was small. Everyone had their eyes on Aiden, so Philip’s voice now sounded especially piercing to his ears.</p>  <p id = > Aiden had wanted to go over to the staff members, but he abruptly stopped and turned to the side, looking annoyed.</p>  <p id = > Philip was tugging at Martha, seeming to be advising her on something, but Martha was reluctant to pay him any mind. She pointed at him and berated, “Philip, beat it! Is there any place for you to speak up here? If Aiden can’t help, can a wretched piece of trash like you help?”</p>  <p id = > Not just Martha, now everyone was looking at Philip with contempt in their eyes. So this was Martha’s useless son-in-law. What a chatty brat, he really was useless.</p>  <p id = > Right now, other than Aiden, who was a man of status, who else here could say that they could solve this problem?</p>  <p id = > Upon seeing this situation, Aiden walked over to Philip with a mocking look on his face. “Why? Do you feel upset? Why don’t you take a good look at yourself? Can you solve a problem like this?”</p>   <h2 id =chapter-51 > Chapter 51</h2> <p id = > Philip felt the hair on his skin stand under the scrutiny of the crowd. He then saw Aiden walking over to him with a smirk.</p>  <p id = > “Philip, try repeating what you’ve said just now. I didn’t hear it clearly.” Aiden looked patronizing. This Philip really likes to speak up wherever he’s not needed. Doesn’t he know his place? To even dare to spout such nonsense. If I, Aiden Grant, can’t settle this, would a piece of trash like him be able to?</p>  <p id = > Philip pouted. After some thought, he answered honestly, “I said that the matter today would not be as easy as it seems. There might be illegal fund-raising involved in this, so I don’t think a favor from someone would be able to solve it. Hence, I’d like to ask a friend for help. Is there a problem?”</p>  <p id = > At this, Aiden immediately snorted. “Holy sh*t, you’re really something Philip. You even have friends now? Why? Feel like playing hero today? Sure, why don’t you handle this?”</p>  <p id = > After Aiden spoke, the older folks around started bombarding insults.</p>  <p id = > “Martha, what does your son-in-law mean? Does he want to take the lead? He looks so shabby, what can he do? Wouldn’t this just be an embarrassment?”</p>  <p id = > “This is Martha’s son-in-law, a wretched piece of trash who makes deliveries. What can he do? Stop acting almighty and talking big!”</p>  <p id = > “Youngsters nowadays really like to dream too far without being realistic. Perhaps he’s feeling upset cause he saw how capable Aiden is.”</p>  <p id = > Martha was immediately furious when she heard her friend’s mocking Philip. Slap! She threw a hard slap across Philip’s face and yelled angrily, “Beat it! There’s nothing for you to do here! One more word from you, and I’ll make Wynnie divorce you!”</p>  <p id = > Philip froze. He could feel his cheeks boil. His gaze turned cold as a fire burned in his chest. However, he could not show his mother-in-law any temper.</p>  <p id = > After she was done scolding Philip, Martha tugged on Aiden’s arm apologetically and smiled at him. “Addy, don’t listen to Philip’s nonsense. What does a slacking piece of trash like him know? We still need you to help us with this.”</p>  <p id = > This was like a soap opera in the eyes of the crowd. They only found it more amusing as they watched on. The crowd’s insults and mockery became harsher at this, and that pleased Aiden even more. He was here to show off his capabilities and connections to his future mother-in-law today, so how could he let Philip take that glory from him? Moreover, what right did trash like Philip have to put on an act in front of him?</p>  <p id = > At this thought, Aiden lifted his chin and stared down at Philip condescendingly. “Didn’t you say you can solve this? Then, you do it. I want to see just what you, Philip Clarke, can do to settle this issue today.”</p>  <p id = > Philip frowned hard. When he noticed how his mother-in-law was glaring at him like she wanted to swallow him alive, and the dark expressions of all the older folks around as they gritted their teeth, Philip knew that he should not do anything. “I’m sorry, my friend has something up, so he can’t help. Why don’t you do it, after all.” Philip sighed.</p>  <p id = > Aiden chuckled. He gave Philip a vicious shove then said cheekily, “Since you don’t have any capabilities, why did you put on an act earlier? Envious of me?” It’s so obvious that you’re jealous of me. I, Aiden Grant, am so handsome, so rich. What rights do you, Philip, have to act in front of me?</p>  <p id = > However, Philip merely smiled and stood quietly in a corner. Why should he waste time talking to a narcissist?</p>  <p id = > At this, the crowd burst into laughter.</p>  <p id = > “There are so many types of youngsters today. Doesn’t he feel ashamed? He’s dressed so shabbily and even talks nonsense. Now that it’s backfired, he’s behaving like a coward.”</p>  <p id = > “Don’t say that. He’s still Martha’s son-in-law. Although he’s a piece of trash, at least he has good in-laws.”</p>  <p id = > As Philip listened to these baseless gossips, he felt helpless. His mother-in-law was even now cozying up to Aiden, chattering happily with him, seemingly closer to him than she was with this son-in-law of hers. Philip went to a corner, and when no one was looking, he called Theo.</p>  <p id = > At the same time, within the private room of a prestigious hotel, the interior design was luxurious and there were tall, beautiful staff waiting inside. Theo was enjoying himself, having a drink with a middle-aged fat man. To be more precise, that middle-aged fat man was trying to flatter Theo.</p>  <p id = > The large man was smiling brightly as he took out a silver bank card from his black wallet and, together with a stack of contracts, handed it respectfully to Theo who was currently smoking a cigar.</p>  <p id = > If there were anyone else in the room, they would definitely recognize this large middle-aged man. The president of Lucrative Funds Finance Company, Lamar Collins.</p>  <p id = > “Brother Theo, this is the company’s bonus from last month. There are six million dollars, and here are thirteen real estate contracts,” said Lamar.</p>  <p id = > Theo narrowed his eyes and nodded, asking his men to receive the offerings without restraint. He then patted Lamar’s shoulder with a smile and said, “Mr. Collins, this will be the last time. Don’t look for me again after this. Your company is dangerous, and I’ve already cleaned my hands from this field. I will advise you to convert your business as well. If things get serious, you might need to go to prison.”</p>  <p id = > Lamar answered with a smile, “Don’t worry, Brother Theo. This had nothing to do with you. So, if anything happens, I will be solely responsible. This is just my little token of appreciation. If it weren’t for you supporting me back then, I would have never made it today.”</p>  <p id = > Theo nodded and said nothing else.</p>                   <h2 id =chapter-52 > Chapter 52</h2> <p id = > He knew what Lamar’s company did. He had told him multiple times.</p>  <p id = > However, this industry was like an endless pit. He was just going to fall deeper and deeper.</p>  <p id = > Did Theo not contact some people to help him with the incident a few days ago?</p>  <p id = > “How should we take care of the clients?” Theo asked.</p>  <p id = > Lamar chuckled coldly. “It’s just a bunch of uncultured old men and women. If they don’t want to invest, do they think they can bring their money into the coffin with them?”</p>  <p id = > Lamar said after seeing Theo’s face falling. “It’s fine, Theo. I know what I’m doing. They are all seniors with no backgrounds.”</p>  <p id = > When he said that, Theo felt more relieved.</p>  <p id = > When the two of them were about to drink, Theo’s phone rang.</p>  <p id = > He looked at the caller ID. It was Mr. Clarke!</p>  <p id = > In an instant, Theo picked up his phone respectfully and shushed Lamar. He said, “It’s Mr. Clarke.”</p>  <p id = > Lamar’s eyes gave an ominous glint when he heard that.</p>  <p id = > Theo had told him about Mr. Clarke before. He was an extraordinary person.</p>  <p id = > He wanted to curry favor with him.</p>  <p id = > “Mr. Clarke, is there anything you want to tell me?” Theo asked respectfully and excitedly.</p>  <p id = > On the other end of the phone, Philip said calmly, “Do you know the president of Lucrative Funds Finance Company?”</p>  <p id = > Clank.</p>  <p id = > Theo started feeling uneasy. He peered at Lamar who was sitting next to him and nodded. He said, “I do. Did he offend you?”</p>  <p id = > It would not be such a coincidence, right?</p>  <p id = > “No,” Philip replied. Theo let out a sigh of relief.</p>  <p id = > However, what Philip said next almost infuriated Theo.</p>  <p id = > “His company scammed a house from my mother-in-law. If you know him, ask him to return the house. Oh, also, there’s a group of seniors outside his company. You’d better ask him to take care of that as well.”</p>  <p id = > When Philip was done talking, Theo stood up abruptly. He nodded his head quickly while responding, “Alright, I’ll get in touch with him now.”</p>  <p id = > He hung up the phone.</p>  <p id = > Bam!</p>  <p id = > Lamar was still smiling when Theo kicked him on his body. Lamar fell from the table to the floor. Theo yelled at him angrily, “Lamar Collins! Do you know what you’ve f*cking done?”</p>  <p id = > Lamar clutched his stomach and threw up the alcohol he consumed just now. He said innocently, “Theo, don’t scare me. I didn’t do anything.”</p>  <p id = > Theo slapped him and yelled angrily, “Did you scam a senior’s house?”</p>  <p id = > Lamar nodded. “I scammed a lot of houses from seniors. They were all people with no backgrounds. It should be fine.”</p>  <p id = > Lamar was telling the truth. He would not dare to scam people with backgrounds.</p>  <p id = > If not, he would be asking for death.</p>  <p id = > “Bullsh*t! Do you know whose house you scammed?” Theo was furious.</p>  <p id = > He scammed Mr. Clarke’s mother-in-law of her house! Did he want to die?</p>  <p id = > “W-who?” Lamar was stunned. This was the first time he saw Theo so mad.</p>  <p id = > “Mr. Clarke’s mother-in-law!” Theo roared.</p>  <p id = > Boom!</p>  <p id = > Lamar fell to the ground lifelessly. His legs were shaking as he muttered, “No way. How is that possible? They’re all nobodies. I checked.”</p>  <p id = > “Yeah, right. F*ck off back to your office. If you don’t take care of this properly, you should just kill yourself.”</p>  <p id = > Theo roared and dragged the terrified Lamar out of the hotel. They got into the car and drove back to the company.</p>              <h2 id =chapter-53 > Chapter 53</h2> <p id = > Now, back to Philip.</p>  <p id = > After he hung up the phone, he went back to where he was. In the end, the seniors around him started to mumble in disdain. They moved away from him as if he was the plague.</p>  <p id = > “What’s going in? He’s an adult and he’s still embarrassing himself.”</p>  <p id = > “Martha is so unlucky to have a son-in-law like him.”</p>  <p id = > “Ew, let’s go. I smell a disgusting fox among us.”</p>  <p id = > Philip backed away to one side after listening to the cruel accusations and jeers from everyone. He leaned against the wall and crossed his arms to watch what was going on.</p>  <p id = > Aiden saw Philip’s ordeal and was feeling amazing. He flipped him off with glee. Under the heated gaze of the seniors, he straightened his suit and walked over to the manager and staff.</p>  <p id = > “Hello, Sir. Can I help you?”</p>  <p id = > The manager was a woman. Her face was pointy and she had a tiny waist. She was thin but still looked stunning. She was wearing a black business attire with a white patterned shirt that made her look skilled and experienced.</p>  <p id = > “Are you the manager here?” Aiden asked with a handsome smile on his face.</p>  <p id = > He looked at the woman and thought that she looked pretty. If possible, he wanted to make her his secretary or personal assistant.</p>  <p id = > “Yes, Sir. However, our company is going through some changes these few days. So, if it’s about business, I’m afraid you’ll have to come back in a few days.”</p>  <p id = > Judy Walter answered politely.</p>  <p id = > She noticed that the seniors who were blocking the door had asked this handsome man to help them.</p>  <p id = > Plus, from what she could gather, he had quite a position in society. He might even know her boss.</p>  <p id = > “I know what your company does. It’s no use telling me that. I’m going to tell you to return the seniors their money. I’ve already asked my father to contact your president. I might have an answer in a while.”</p>  <p id = > “And my house,” Martha stood at one side and said when she saw the opportunity.</p>  <p id = > “Don’t worry, Aunty Martha. I’ll help you ask for it back.”</p>  <p id = > Aiden nodded his head and said. However, his smirk betrayed what he was really thinking.</p>  <p id = > It felt good to be in the limelight, indeed.</p>  <p id = > Judy smiled and apologized, “I’m sorry, Sir. This is business-related, so I have no right to make a decision. Since you know our president, please wait patiently or perhaps, you can ask him to drop by?”</p>  <p id = > It was not strange that Judy would not believe Aiden.</p>  <p id = > Return their money?</p>  <p id = > Sorry, but it was impossible unless the president came here and returned the money himself.</p>  <p id = > After she said that, Aiden’s face fell. He glanced at Judy’s nametag coldly and said, “Manager Judy, right? I’m Aiden Grant. I’m the CEO of Stardream Media. My father is Gordon Grant, and he’s the chairman of Splendor Education Group. You should have heard of it, right? Do you think I’m making this up?”</p>  <p id = > When he said that, Aiden could not hide the glee in his eyes.</p>  <p id = > His father was the chairman of Splendor Education Group. Their asset was worth more than one billion!</p>  <p id = > They were the leading education group in Riverdale!</p>  <p id = > Plus, they had close connections with the education bureau.</p>  <p id = > It could be said that if you were living in Riverdale and you were educated, then you would be connected to Splendor.</p>  <p id = > There were more than ten education institutions under Splendor including schools. Splendor was everywhere from kindergartens, primary schools, and even universities.</p>  <p id = > This was why Aiden was superior to most people.</p>  <p id = > Judy frowned when she heard that. She smiled lightly and said, “Mr. Grant, it’s not that we’re not returning the money. It’s just that we have to wait for our president to make a statement. Why don’t you call him and ask him?”</p>  <p id = > Judy knew she could not offend Aiden, so she could only decline him as politely as she could.</p>  <p id = > “Alright, just you wait. I’ll call him now.”</p>  <p id = > Aiden did not want to cause trouble for this woman as well. He turned around and called his father after taking out his phone. “Hey, Dad. What’s the progress?”</p>  <p id = > “I’m very busy now. I don’t have time. Don’t call me for minor things like this. I know Mr. Collins from Lucrative Funds Finance Company, but you’re just making assumptions about him. Aren’t you cutting off his source of income?”</p>  <p id = > On the other end of the phone, Gordon scolded him angrily. “Come back here right this instant. Don’t get yourself involved in this. Do you know who’s supporting Mr. Collins behind his back?”</p>  <p id = > Aiden was stunned. He did not expect his father to not help him. Was this little company difficult to deal with?</p>  <p id = > “Who? Are they better than us?” Aiden asked.</p>  <p id = > “Theo Zander!” Gordon said firmly. “That’s enough. Get your *ss back here right now. I won’t be able to help you if you get into trouble.”</p>  <p id = > Theo’s name was enough to get Gordon’s attention.</p>  <p id = > A person who was born a thug and ended up with a legitimate business should not be viewed lightly.</p>  <p id = > Aiden was shocked when he heard Theo’s name. He started to panic.</p>  <p id = > His face fell and darkened.</p>  <p id = > He hung up the call, and the seniors surrounded him to ask him a ton of questions.</p>  <p id = > “How is it, Aiden? Is it solved? Can we get our money back? Can I get my house back too?” Martha was impatient to know the result.</p>  <p id = > “Hey, it’s Aiden Grant we’re talking about. If he’s willing to stand up for us, then of course he’ll be able to solve this! Right, Mr. Grant?” someone asked.</p>  <p id = > “Yeah, Mr. Grant is handsome and skilled. Plus, he’s the young master of Splendor. This kind of thing is a piece of cake for him.”</p>  <p id = > Looking at the fervent gazes of the seniors, Aiden knew he was in deep trouble. He had just made a huge promise to them and it would be embarrassing if he said he could not solve it now.</p>  <p id = > Plus, Martha was involved in this.</p>          <h2 id =chapter-54 > Chapter 54</h2> <p id = > If he embarrassed himself in front of his future mother-in-law right now, it would mean that he would lose his chance with Wynn.</p>  <p id = > When he thought of this, Aiden forced out a smile and said with a quiver in his voice, “Um, ladies and gentlemen, it’s done. Don’t worry. I called Mr. Collins and he’ll come here to handle this in a bit, so don’t worry. You can go back and wait for further news.”</p>  <p id = > When everyone heard that, they cheered and clapped for Aiden.</p>  <p id = > “Mr. Grant is such an extraordinary man. He managed to solve the problem right after standing up for us. If my daughter was not married, I’ll definitely ask her to marry Mr. Grant.”</p>  <p id = > “Yeah! Mr. Grant is such an amazing young man. You can’t come across this kind of man easily now. Martha, you’ve got yourself a gem!”</p>  <p id = > “Hehe, I remember someone talking big about how he can solve this just now. Now that Mr. Grant has solved this, where’s that person who was talking big?”</p>  <p id = > “Don’t talk about that trash of a man anymore. He’s just playing to the gallery.”</p>  <p id = > The crowd cheered for Aiden and criticized Philip who was incompatible with the crowd.</p>  <p id = > Aiden did not care anymore. He was enjoying this kind of treatment, especially when Martha was looking at him like he was a block of gold.</p>  <p id = > “Aiden, don’t worry. I’m going to agree to this thing between you and Wynn now.”</p>  <p id = > Martha grabbed Aiden’s hand and smiled brightly.</p>  <p id = > When she looked over at Philip, she started to feel angry just from looking at that idiot.</p>  <p id = > She wanted so badly for her daughter to divorce Philip and marry Aiden instead.</p>  <p id = > Philip stood in a corner and watched, ruminating as everyone praised Aiden.</p>  <p id = > He knew what had happened, but this man was still acting so shamelessly.</p>  <p id = > Should he expose him?</p>  <p id = > Never mind. His mother-in-law would despise him for that.</p>  <p id = > Judy stood at the entrance of the office and watched everything happen suspiciously.</p>  <p id = > Did Aiden really call her boss? Why did she not receive any messages?</p>  <p id = > “Mr. Grant, are you sure Mr. Collins will be here later?” Judy asked.</p>  <p id = > This question felt like a splash of cold water over Aiden’s head. He woke up immediately from his enjoyment.</p>  <p id = > “Um, Mr. Collins will be here in a bit.” Aiden decided to just deceive Judy.</p>  <p id = > What else should he do?</p>  <p id = > He was clearly lying.</p>  <p id = > If Mr. Collins did not come here, it would be a slap in his face.</p>  <p id = > No, he had to call his father again. He had to get Mr. Collins to show his face no matter what.</p>  <p id = > If it came down to it, he would just pay him back with a house.</p>  <p id = > At this moment, a Mercedes-Benz stopped in the distance. A man with a beer belly walked out from the car hurriedly. He almost fell in the process.</p>  <p id = > It was Lamar!</p>  <p id = > At this moment, he was panicking. He had been brought over by Theo.</p>  <p id = > Theo did not get out of the car. He only sat in the car and watched Philip who stood out from the crowd.</p>  <p id = > He hoped he could still make it.</p>  <p id = > “Look, it’s Mr. Collins! Mr. Collins is here!” someone yelled out in the crowd.</p>  <p id = > Everyone looked over at the same time and saw Lamar running over.</p>  <p id = > In an instant, everyone immediately felt extremely grateful to Aiden.</p>  <p id = > “Look, Mr. Grant is indeed amazing. Mr. Collins is really here!”</p>  <p id = > “We can definitely get our money back now. Mr. Grant, thank you so much!”</p>  <p id = > “Martha, you have to hold on to Aiden at all costs. He’s such an amazing candidate for your son-in-law. You can’t pass him up.”</p>  <p id = > Martha was extremely grateful. A flower was blooming in her heart when she listened to the flatteries of the other middle-aged women.</p>  <p id = > However, Aiden was nervous because he knew he had not managed to contact Mr. Collins.</p>  <p id = > Why was he here?</p>  <p id = > Was it Philip’s doing?</p>  <p id = > Aiden’s gaze landed on Philip who was looking bored. He denied that thought immediately.</p>  <p id = > Impossible!</p>  <p id = > He was just a useless piece of trash!</p>  <p id = > Mr. Collins was the president of a company. How would Philip know him?</p>  <p id = > When everyone was gathering around Lamar, he wiped the sweat off his forehead with a handkerchief. Then, he ran over to Aiden and Philip.</p>             <h2 id =chapter-55 > Chapter 55</h2> <p id = > Lamar ran over hurriedly to see Mr. Clarke.</p>  <p id = > However, the seniors blocked him and asked all at once.</p>  <p id = > “Mr. Collins, can we get the rebate from the money we invested today?”</p>  <p id = > “Can you return our money? I don’t want to invest anymore.”</p>  <p id = > “Our houses too. Please give it back to us. We don’t want to put up collateral anymore. You’re a scammer!”</p>  <p id = > In an instant, emotions were heightened. The seniors were all making threats at Lamar while surrounding him like they were layers and layers of clothes on his body.</p>  <p id = > Lamar was panicking. He waved his hands and cleared his throat before saying, “Everybody, please calm down. I’m here to return the money and houses to you all. Please go and register over there. I’ll ask my staff to go through the procedure with you all. Please don’t panic, okay? I have to meet someone important right now.”</p>  <p id = > After he said that, Lamar called over his staff who then brought the seniors away.</p>  <p id = > When the seniors heard that their money and houses would be returned, they were ecstatic. They were smiling widely while raising their thumbs at Aiden.</p>  <p id = > “Mr. Grant, it’s all thanks to you.”</p>  <p id = > “Mr. Grant is such an amazing man. I’m so grateful to you. You must have a bright future ahead of you.”</p>  <p id = > Of course, some were also fawning over Martha. They stood around her and said flatteringly, “Martha, you’ve found yourself a rich son-in-law. I know Aiden is not an ordinary man. You have to keep him by your side.”</p>  <p id = > “Yeah, Martha. If your daughter doesn’t want to marry him, I’ll make my move. Coincidentally, my idiot daughter has no boyfriend yet.”</p>  <p id = > When Martha heard that, she panicked. She said, “Don’t even think about it. He’s my potential son-in-law, and only my Wynn is suitable for him.”</p>  <p id = > When she said that, she looked over at Aiden. She felt such calmness and joy when she looked at him.</p>  <p id = > It was because of him that she was able to show off in front of her friends today.</p>  <p id = > If it was that piece of trash Philip, she would definitely be humiliated.</p>  <p id = > With that in mind, Martha walked over to Aiden and thanked him profusely. “Aiden, it’s all thanks to you today. If not, I wouldn’t have known what to do.”</p>  <p id = > “Aunty Martha, you’re flattering me. This is what I should do,” Aiden said courteously.</p>  <p id = > Martha was smiling so widely that she could not close her mouth. She looked at Aiden intensely and asked suddenly, “Aiden, are you free tonight? Have dinner at my place. I’ll ask Wynn to come back earlier to accompany you.”</p>  <p id = > The only thing Martha wanted to do right now was to pair up Aiden and Wynn. She could not let this amazing son-in-law escape.</p>  <p id = > What about Philip, though?</p>  <p id = > Martha did not even care about Philip anymore. He was just a coward. He could just go and do whatever he wanted.</p>  <p id = > Aiden was smiling brightly while his heart bloomed.</p>  <p id = > He figured his marriage with Wynn was already halfway done.</p>  <p id = > When Philip saw this, his eyebrows knitted together tightly. He was very unhappy.</p>  <p id = > His mother-in-law was insufferably snobbish.</p>  <p id = > He was standing right there and she was trying to tie the knot between Aiden and his wife.</p>  <p id = > If this was tolerable, what was not?</p>  <p id = > Plus, did Aiden really solve this mess?</p>  <p id = > Lamar made his way to Aiden and grabbed his hands. He said with a grin on his face, “Mr. Clarke, nice to meet you. Look, I’ve returned the houses and money. Are you satisfied now?”</p>  <p id = > Aiden was chatting with Martha when he was interrupted by Lamar all of a sudden. Plus, it seemed like he got the wrong person.</p>  <p id = > “Mr. Clarke? My name is Aiden Grant.”</p>  <p id = > Aiden frowned and looked at Lamar. At the same time, he was curious and peered at Philip.</p>  <p id = > What was going on?</p>  <p id = > At this moment, Martha looked at Philip in puzzlement. She said angrily, “Mr. Collins, you’ve got the wrong person. This is Aiden. Aiden Grant. He’s the one who called you. If not, we wouldn’t have been able to get in touch with you at all.”</p>  <p id = > In Martha’s eyes, Lamar was the president of Lucrative Funds Finance Company.</p>  <p id = > Before this, she would have wanted to win favors with people like him.</p>  <p id = > However, it was different now. Aiden could get Mr. Collins to come over with just a phone call and he could make him return the money and houses. He was even greater than Mr. Collins.</p>  <p id = > As such, she started to look down on Lamar even more.</p>  <p id = > Lamar blinked furiously while looking at Aiden and Martha who looked annoyed. He was curious. Was Mr. Clarke not Mr. Clarke? Was it just an alias?</p>  <p id = > No, that could not be. He was sure of it!</p>  <p id = > Theo had told him that Mr. Clarke liked to keep a low profile.</p>  <p id = > Plus, he was the only rich and handsome young man at the scene. The other young man there did not look as well-off.</p>  <p id = > With such a comparison, Lamar was convinced that Aiden was Mr. Clarke.</p>  <p id = > It was probably just an alias because he wanted to keep a low profile.</p>     <h2 id =chapter-56 > Chapter 56</h2> <p id = > When he thought about that, Lamar laughed and said, “Oh, Mr. Grant. I’m sorry I called you the wrong name. Please forgive me.”</p>  <p id = > When Aiden heard that, his nervousness vanished.</p>  <p id = > When Lamar had called him Mr. Clarke earlier, he was extremely nervous.</p>  <p id = > He knew better than anyone else that he had not done anything.</p>  <p id = > Did his father do something?</p>  <p id = > Possibly. After all, he was his father. There was no reason for him to not help him, right?</p>  <p id = > When Aiden heard Lamar saying that he called the wrong name, he let out a sigh of relief. He smiled and said, “Mr. Collins, you’re so hilarious. I thought that trash over there called you.”</p>  <p id = > Philip was just standing there on one side of the room. He frowned when Aiden suddenly mentioned him.</p>  <p id = > On the other hand, Lamar continued to say in a flattering manner, “Mr. Grant, you must be joking. How would I know a poor fella like him?”</p>  <p id = > The man before him, on the other hand, was a very important person. He must get on his good side.</p>  <p id = > He just needed to return the money and houses. It was no big deal.</p>  <p id = > According to Theo, Mr. Clarke, or Mr. Grant, was someone who could control the world.</p>  <p id = > If he could get his recognition, he would be able to prosper.</p>  <p id = > “Mr. Collins, since you’re here, please take care of this mess. I don’t want to add more fuel to the fire. Please do your best.”</p>  <p id = > Aiden put his hand behind his back and lifted his chin. He looked arrogant and obnoxious. It was as if Lamar did not matter to him.</p>  <p id = > After all, Splendor Education Group had assets that were worth one billion!</p>  <p id = > Plus, his father knew so many leaders from different industries.</p>  <p id = > If Lamar could come here to return the money, it meant that his father had given him a lot of pressure.</p>  <p id = > Of course, these were all Aiden’s imaginations.</p>  <p id = > He did not know what was really going on.</p>  <p id = > Lamar really thought Aiden was Mr. Clarke. He nodded and bowed before saying, “Of course, of course. You’re absolutely right, Mr. Grant.”</p>  <p id = > Martha and a group of seniors were very surprised when they saw Aiden lecturing Lamar like a teacher lecturing his student.</p>  <p id = > As such, Martha was more determined to pair up Aiden and Wynn.</p>  <p id = > The seniors were all praising Aiden while surrounding him. They were talking about him among each other.</p>  <p id = > “Aiden is amazing. It’ll be great if my son’s like him.”</p>  <p id = > “Yeah, he’s the president of an enterprise at such a young age. He’s also the young master of Splendor Education group. No one can compare to him.”</p>  <p id = > “Look at the other guy. He’s just standing there like a fool. He was still talking so loudly just now. How embarrassing!”</p>  <p id = > The seniors started criticizing Philip again mid-conversation.</p>  <p id = > Philip was helpless as well. Was Lamar an idiot? How could he get the wrong person?</p>  <p id = > However, he could not do anything. Should he go up there and tell him?</p>  <p id = > It would be like asking for death.</p>  <p id = > The seniors would definitely kill him.</p>  <p id = > Never mind, then.</p>  <p id = > Aiden saw Philip’s bitter expression and started sneering at him in his heart. He walked to him and patted his shoulder. He comforted pretentiously, “Philip, don’t be sad. Take one step at a time, and perhaps one day, you’ll be like me. Even though it might be in your next life, but at least you have a goal now.”</p>  <p id = > After he said that, Aiden could not help but let out a huge laugh.</p>  <p id = > Everyone started to laugh along with him.</p>  <p id = > Martha started laughing as well. Her hatred toward Philip was getting more and more intense.</p>  <p id = > She had never treated Philip like he was her son-in-law.</p>  <p id = > Lamar walked over and interrupted Aiden. “Mr. Grant, um, do you have time? Theo is here and wants to meet you. Why don’t we talk in the car?”</p>  <p id = > Aiden was shocked. There was puzzlement in his eyes.</p>  <p id = > Who the f*ck was Theo?</p>  <p id = > What the hell was going on with Lamar?</p>  <p id = > “I don’t care if he’s Theo or Teddy. I don’t know him. Do you think I’ll just meet anyone?”</p>  <p id = > Aiden was annoyed.</p>  <p id = > When he said that, Lamar was stunned.</p>  <p id = > He did not know Theo?</p>  <p id = > Lamar started to feel agitated. Then, he remembered what happened earlier when he called him Mr. Clarke.</p>  <p id = > Did he really get the wrong person?</p>  <p id = > At the same time, Lamar got a message on his phone. It was from Theo.</p>  <p id = > “Lamar Collins! You got the wrong f*cking person! That one is Mr. Clarke!”</p>  <p id = > Boom!</p>  <p id = > All of a sudden, Lamar’s head started buzzing. His breathing became rapid and his pupils constricted.</p>  <p id = > ‘F*ck!</p>  <p id = > ‘I got the wrong f*cking person!’</p>  <p id = > Lamar grabbed his phone and stared at Philip who had a weird expression on his face. Sweat started pouring out from his forehead.</p>  <p id = > While Aiden was pointing sarcastically and laughing at Philip, a sound was heard.</p>  <p id = > Smack!</p>  <p id = > Lamar was furious. He approached Aiden who was smirking evilly and slapped him across the face. He yelled, “You motherf*cker! Who the f*ck are you?”</p>  <p id = > At that moment, everyone was shocked.</p>          <h2 id =chapter-57 > Chapter 57</h2> <p id = > What was going on?</p>  <p id = > Why were they fighting?</p>  <p id = > The seniors were so shocked that they were speechless. Aiden himself was stunned for a very long time. He did not know what was going on.</p>  <p id = > “F*ck! Lamar Collins! Are you f*cking insane? Why the f*ck are you hitting me?”</p>  <p id = > Aiden was furious. His face had turned red. This was so embarrassing.</p>  <p id = > In the first second, he had been trying to flatter him. Now, Lamar was slapping him across the face.</p>  <p id = > When Martha saw that Aiden was slapped, she was enraged. She ran over and pushed Lamar. She yelled, “Are you insane? Why did you slap Aiden? If you don’t give us an explanation now, we’ll stand in front of your office and call the cops on you!”</p>  <p id = > Lamar was livid. He pushed away Martha who was being rude and unreasonable. Then, he roared, “F*ck off! How dare this f*cker pretend to be Mr. Clarke? I went easy on him! I should skin him alive and pluck out all of his nerves!”</p>  <p id = > When he said that, Lamar glanced at Philip who was standing at one side.</p>  <p id = > Then, he ignored the seniors who were making a ruckus and walked to Philip. He smiled widely and bowed. He immediately apologized. “I’m sorry, Mr. Clarke. I was blind, so I got the wrong person. Are you alright? Should I punish that idiot for you?”</p>  <p id = > Lamar was talking about Aiden.</p>  <p id = > Everyone shut up when they saw this scene.</p>  <p id = > Mr. Clarke?</p>  <p id = > Lamar was insane!</p>  <p id = > He was apologizing to a coward and calling him mister. It was such an insult to call him that.</p>  <p id = > Aiden was livid. He felt that he had lost all respect. He yelled, “Collins, you’re f*cking out of your mind! What the f*ck do you mean by Mr. Clarke? His name is Philip Clarke and he’s just a cowardly delivery guy! Do you know what you just did? Do you know what you’re doing right now?”</p>  <p id = > F*ck!</p>  <p id = > Aiden was vehement.</p>  <p id = > Lamar was a huge idiot. He was being so respectful to a coward.</p>  <p id = > Lamar turned his face and pulled on the collar of his suit. He said coldly, “I don’t need you to tell me what to do. You’re Aiden, right? Why did you pretend to be Mr. Clarke?”</p>  <p id = > Pretend?</p>  <p id = > Aiden was confused. He pointed at Philip and scoffed. “Why should I pretend to be that idiot? Can’t you see the difference between me and him? He’s just a piece of trash. Why should he have the rights to stand here?”</p>  <p id = > After he said that…</p>  <p id = > Lamar ran over to him and punched him in the face. His nose started bleeding profusely.</p>  <p id = > After that, the crowd went crazy.</p>  <p id = > “F*ck! Collins, you’re a dead man! If you don’t give me an explanation right now, I’ll make you disappear from Riverdale!”</p>  <p id = > Aiden yelled loudly as he clutched his nose. Blood was seeping out from the space between his fingers.</p>  <p id = > Martha handed Aiden some tissues to stop the bleeding. Her heart hurt from seeing that. At the same time, she turned to Lamar and shrieked, “Call the police! Call the police now! Put this man in jail!”</p>  <p id = > Lamar was furious. He swung his hand and was about to slap Martha across the face.</p>  <p id = > Martha’s eyes went wide. Then, she closed her eyes from fear.</p>  <p id = > However...</p>  <p id = > A hand grabbed Lamar’s suddenly. A voice said, “Mr. Collins, that’s enough. She’s my mother-in-law.”</p>  <p id = > Who else could it be?</p>  <p id = > It must be Philip.</p>  <p id = > He could not watch this anymore.</p>  <p id = > Lamar’s heart fell as he trembled vigorously. His entire body went cold.</p>  <p id = > F*ck!</p>  <p id = > She was Mr. Clark’s mother-in-law!</p>  <p id = > No way. Why was his mother-in-law siding with an outsider?</p>  <p id = > Before he could think, Lamar bowed and apologized to Philip. “I’m sorry, Mr. Clarke. I… I had no idea.”</p>  <p id = > When he said that, Lamar’s voice changed. He sounded terrified.</p>  <p id = > Now, everyone understood.</p>  <p id = > Mr. Collins was scared of Philip.</p>  <p id = > Could it be that Philip was the one who helped them?</p>  <p id = > Everyone including Martha was puzzled. She was in a state of shock right now.</p>  <p id = > Since when did her cowardly son-in-law become so talented?</p>  <p id = > Philip only glanced at Lamar coldly before the latter apologized to Martha immediately. “Madam Yates, I am so sorry. I was too impulsive just now. I will return your money and house first. I’ll even give you an interest of 300,000 bucks!”</p>  <p id = > Martha was angry, but when she heard the word ‘money’, she started breathing heavily as a smile blossomed on her face.</p>  <p id = > “Aw, what are you talking about, Mr. Collins? Are you really giving me an interest of 300,000 bucks?”</p>  <p id = > Martha was a money-grubber. She immediately ignored Aiden who was standing behind her when she heard Lamar talking about money. Plus, it was 300,000 bucks.</p>  <p id = > Lamar nodded and said, “Of course! You invested so much. Of course, you’ll get something in return.”</p>  <p id = > “Great! That’s amazing! Can I have it now?” Martha was so happy that even her smile was crooked.</p>  <p id = > Before Lamar could answer, the seniors started making noises again.</p>  <p id = > “No way, Mr. Collins. We invested too! Do we get something in return as well?”</p>  <p id = > “Why is she the only one who’ll get interest?”</p>  <p id = > “I was the first to invest in your company. Shouldn’t you return my money first?”</p>  <p id = > Everyone was coming in strong. Lamar had no choice but to yell, “What are you doing? Madam Yates is Mr. Clarke’s mother-in-law. I’m happy to return her money first and give her something in return. That’s my business. Just wait at one side!”</p>  <p id = > Even though the crowd was not pleased, their anger was diminished slightly.</p>  <p id = > After all, the president was the one who decided if he wanted to return the money and house or not.</p>  <p id = > They did not dare to be so aggressive.</p>  <p id = > However, they started to hate Philip even more.</p>  <p id = > This was a trait shared by humans.</p>  <p id = > If they could not get something, they would hate and resent.</p>           <h2 id =chapter-58 > Chapter 58</h2> <p id = > “What’s going on? Aiden’s the one who solved this, right? Why is Mr. Collins here for Philip?”</p>  <p id = > “Are you only seeing it now? Who is Philip? Isn’t he just a piece of trash?”</p>  <p id = > “Martha is unreliable. She’s treating us like we’re fools!”</p>  <p id = > The seniors gathered together and started gossiping. Their faces were filled with shock and envy.</p>  <p id = > Martha could see it now. Mr. Collins had come here for her son-in-law.</p>  <p id = > She pulled Philip to one side and asked in a flattering way, “Philip, do you know Mr. Collins?”</p>  <p id = > This was the first time Philip felt this kindness from her.</p>  <p id = > Philip wanted to tell her the truth, but after pondering, he said, “Mom, you’re mistaken. How would I know a man like Mr. Collins? I just called a friend of his and coincidentally, he’s responsible for this. Maybe he’s the one exerting pressure on him?”</p>  <p id = > When Martha heard that, she was not suspicious. She nodded and said disappointedly, “I knew it. You’re just a coward. How would you know people like Mr. Collins?”</p>  <p id = > Philip frowned.</p>  <p id = > His mother-in-law’s attitude toward him changed so quickly.</p>  <p id = > “Alright, leave the rest to me. Don’t talk anymore,” Martha said coldly.</p>  <p id = > She was worried that a foolish guy like Philip would ruin things by running his mouth. Plus, she still wanted to flex in front of her friends.</p>  <p id = > When she thought about this, Martha walked away with her head held high. She pointed at Lamar and scolded, “Mr. Collins, I think you have to get in touch with your conscience. You can’t just give me something, you have to give everyone something too.”</p>  <p id = > Actually, when she said that, she was extremely nervous.</p>  <p id = > After all, she did not know the level of Philip’s friend. She did not know how much influence and power Philip’s friend had over Lamar.</p>  <p id = > When she saw Lamar frowning, she felt even more nervous. She was even ready to change her mind.</p>  <p id = > If it was impossible, then he should just return hers.</p>  <p id = > Who knew Lamar would soon agree with a smile on his face. “Madam Yates, you’re right. I have to tap into my conscience. We’ll just go according to our initial plan. Everyone will get returns. Please go register now and I’ll ask my staff to get the money from the bank later.”</p>  <p id = > Cheers erupted from the crowd after a few seconds of silence.</p>  <p id = > “Thank you, Mr. Collins! Thank you, Lucrative Funds Finance Company!”</p>  <p id = > “Martha, you’re so amazing. This is all thanks to you and your son-in-law.”</p>  <p id = > “Martha, are you hiding something from us? Didn’t you say Philip is useless?”</p>  <p id = > After a while, the entire group of seniors was sweet-talking Martha. She felt like she was about to float away.</p>  <p id = > When they asked about Philip, Martha lied with no shame. “Oh, it’s nothing. Philip is still okay. He knows Mr. Collins from a long time ago.”</p>  <p id = > When she said that, everyone started flattering her non-stop. This was the proudest Martha had ever felt.</p>  <p id = > On the other side, Aiden was ignored by everyone. He glared at Philip with a horrible expression on his face. Then, he snuck away silently.</p>  <p id = > That was so embarrassing!</p>  <p id = > Philip beat him!</p>  <p id = > He even had connections!</p>  <p id = > When he got into the car, he called his father furiously. “Dad, did you help me ask or not?”</p>  <p id = > “Ask what? Get your *ss back here right now! Stop getting yourself involved in this! The party with Civil Trading Group is in a few days. Get back here and make preparations,” Gordon yelled angrily on the other side of the phone.</p>  <p id = > After he hung up the phone, Aiden punched the steering wheel in anger. He glared at Philip through the car window. “Philip Clarke, I’ll never forgive you.”</p>  <p id = > When it was done, Martha warned Philip when they were going home. “You have to keep this secret for me, okay? If not, I’ll ask Wynn to divorce you! Also, take me to see your friend next time. I have to thank him personally.”</p>  <p id = > Actually, Martha already had a plan. She would prepare more backups as her son-in-law.</p>  <p id = > She would not change her opinion about Philip because of what happened today.</p>  <p id = > Trash would always be trash.</p>  <p id = > With no choice, Philip agreed.</p>  <p id = > After everyone left, he got into the Benz with Lamar.</p>  <p id = > A short while later, the car stopped in front of the entrance of Gopher Delivery Services.</p>  <p id = > Theo and Lamar drove away after Philip got out.</p>  <p id = > When he got to the entrance, he saw Agnes playing with Mila.</p>  <p id = > Agnes was a kind and attentive woman. One could tell that she liked Mila a lot.</p>  <p id = > Today, she was wearing a red girdle skirt. Her long and curly hair that was resting on her back gave her the charm of a mature woman.</p>  <p id = > “Mr. Clarke, you’re here.” When Agnes saw Philip, she walked over with Mila. She had a smile on her face.</p>  <p id = > “Daddy!” Mila opened her arms and asked for hugs happily.</p>  <p id = > Philip took over and played with Mila for a while. Then, he asked, “How’s the progress?”</p>  <p id = > “I made a reservation. We can go get the bikes now,” Agnes said before asking hesitantly, “Mr. Clarke, are you sure you want to change all of the bikes to Harley-Davidsons? They cost tens of millions.”</p>  <p id = > Philip smiled and played with Mila. He said, “Yes, change all of them.”</p>  <p id = > In a blink of an eye, Agnes drove her Volkswagen CC with Philip to the Harley-Davidson shop in Maple Road.</p>  <p id = > Philip walked into the shop first while Agnes went to park the car.</p>  <p id = > When he got in, he heard a sweet voice.</p>  <p id = > “Hello, Sir. Are you here to look at bikes? Which one do you have your eyes on? I can introduce it to you. This is the latest Harley Cruiser FXDRTM114. The promotion price for it right now is 340,000 bucks.”</p>  <p id = > “Alright, how many do you have?” Philip asked.</p>  <p id = > “How many?”</p>  <p id = > The salesperson was stunned. What did he mean by how many?</p>  <p id = > When he saw the puzzlement on her face, he explained, “It’s like this. I like Harleys. So, I want to buy 100 for my staff.”</p>  <p id = > He liked Harleys, so he’s buying 100 Harleys for his staff.</p>  <p id = > What did that mean?</p>  <p id = > Was he a nouveau riche?</p>                     <h2 id =chapter-59 > Chapter 59</h2> <p id = > This was the most savage statement Isabelle Ford had ever heard after so many years of selling Harley-Davidsons.</p>  <p id = > He just came up and asked her if they had 100 bikes.</p>  <p id = > Isabelle was stunned. After a while, she said bitterly, “Sir, are you sure you want 100? And you want 100 of the latest models?”</p>  <p id = > Philip nodded indifferently. “Right. Do you not have that many? If not, it’s fine as long as they are Harleys.”</p>  <p id = > Isabelle was stunned once again.</p>  <p id = > It was fine as long as they were Harleys?</p>  <p id = > Just how much did this man like Harleys?</p>  <p id = > “Sir, we only have 32 in stock. We just did the count this morning. We don’t have 100,” Isabelle said sadly.</p>  <p id = > Was this man really a nouveau riche?</p>  <p id = > When Philip heard that, he lifted his eyebrow and looked around. “Only 32?”</p>  <p id = > According to Philip’s calculation, he would at least need 100. Even though they only had more than ten employees, it would be fine if he hired more people.</p>  <p id = > This was the first time Isabelle met a client who wanted to buy 100 Harleys in one go.</p>  <p id = > She could not help but look at Philip up and down.</p>  <p id = > What if he was crazy?</p>  <p id = > After looking at him, her face changed. This guy’s outfit was very normal. He was wearing a pair of jeans that were already white from frequent washing and a white t-shirt. He was also wearing a pair of dirty sport shoes, and he had a rough stubble on his face.</p>  <p id = > A person like this could afford 100 Harleys?</p>  <p id = > Was he just here to be pretentious?</p>  <p id = > When she thought about this, Isabelle’s expression fell. After seeing Philip deep in thought, it made her even more sure that this guy was here to cause trouble.</p>  <p id = > “Sir, do you still want them?” Isabelle asked while controlling her emotions.</p>  <p id = > Philip frowned and shook his head. He said, “You don’t have 100 anyway.”</p>  <p id = > Hehe.</p>  <p id = > This time, Isabelle smirked coldly. He had just blown his cover.</p>  <p id = > ‘100? I think you can’t even afford one. Why are you still pretending to be rich?’</p>  <p id = > “Are you sure you’re here to buy motorcycles?” Isabelle said in a despicable way as she crossed her arms. In just a second, she became arrogant and overbearing.</p>  <p id = > “Yeah, I’m here to buy motorcycles. 100. Do you have them?” Philip frowned. This salesperson did not have the enthusiasm she had just now.</p>  <p id = > “Enough! How long are you going to pretend? 100? I don’t think you can even afford just one! Can’t you see where you are before coming here to put up an act?”</p>  <p id = > Isabelle started shouting in anger.</p>  <p id = > ‘Who the hell is he? How dare he come and cause trouble in the early morning? He must be tired of life!’</p>  <p id = > “How do you know if I can afford them or not? Plus, I made a reservation.” Philip was unhappy.</p>  <p id = > Why was this salesperson looking down on him?  Plus, did she swallow a stick of dynamite this morning? Or was she suffering from an irregular period?</p>  <p id = > “Hahaha, are you kidding me? You’re saying you can afford 100?” Isabelle looked at Philip from head to toe and scoffed. “Sir, if you want to buy a car with two wheels, please go out and turn right. Yadea is just right there. A poor man like you should drive a motorcycle like that. Plus, it’s eco-friendly.”</p>  <p id = > “Isabelle, stop joking. A poor man like him wants to buy a motorcycle?”</p>  <p id = > Another salesperson walked over and jeered. “Do you see what he’s wearing? I don’t think he can even afford a Yadea. He’s just here to take pictures and post them on his social media to show off.”</p>  <p id = > Isabelle chuckled sarcastically and warned Philip. “Get out now. Not every piece of trash can come in here.”</p>  <p id = > Philip was agitated. These people were too snobbish. Did they not know that the rich liked to keep low profiles?</p>  <p id = > Did he really look that poor?</p>  <p id = > Agnes ran in from the door at this moment. She asked, “Mr. Clarke, what’s wrong?”</p>  <p id = > Philip shook his head and looked at the Harleys in the shop. “Let’s go. They don’t welcome us here.”</p>  <p id = > “Don’t welcome us?” Agnes asked surprisingly.</p>  <p id = > Looking at the overbearing salesperson, Agnes knew what was going on.</p>  <p id = > “Hello, I made a reservation to look at the motorcycles today. Please get your manager for me,” Agnes said unhappily. She was trying to control her emotions.</p>  <p id = > “What reservation? There are no reservations today. Get out now. These two actors have even started acting. Mr. Clarke? Are you two idiots?” Isabelle scolded like a madwoman.</p>  <p id = > “You!” Agnes was livid.</p>  <p id = > Philip grabbed her arm and said, “It’s fine. We’ll go next door.”</p>  <p id = > Agnes stomped her feet in anger.</p>  <p id = > The two turned around to leave when Isabelle said sarcastically, “Hehe, you have no money for Harleys yet you want 100.”</p>  <p id = > “Yeah, the moment he came into our shop, I knew he was only here to look at the motorcycles. Next time, we have to put a signboard outside of our shop that says, ‘Poor people and dogs are forbidden to enter’.”</p>  <p id = > Philip clenched his fists and suppressed his anger. He walked out of the door and turned left into a shop selling BMW motorcycles.</p>  <p id = > When he entered the shop, a young salesperson came over. “Sir, do you want to buy a motorcycle?”</p>  <p id = > Philip said flatly, “Yes. I’m buying 100.”</p>  <p id = > “Alright, which one do you like? I can let you know more about it,” the salesperson smiled and said. Even though he did not think a person dressed like Philip would be able to afford it, he still had to introduce the motorcycles to him as it was his duty.</p>  <p id = > However...</p>  <p id = > Suddenly...</p>  <p id = > The salesperson was stunned. He repeated while stammering, “100?”</p>  <p id = > “Yes. 100. Do you have them in stock?” Philip smiled and said.</p>  <p id = > Insane. That was insane. 100 BMV motorcycles.</p>  <p id = > “Sir, please wait. I’ll go get my manager.”</p>   <h2 id =chapter-60 > Chapter 60</h2> <p id = > Thank God the salesperson was quite smart.</p>  <p id = > He called the manager immediately.</p>  <p id = > The manager was a man in his forties. He had a manner that was out of the ordinary. He was smiling and looked amiable.</p>  <p id = > He reached out his hand to Philip. “Hello, Sir. I am the manager of this BMW motorcycle specialty shop. My name is John Smith.”</p>  <p id = > Philip grabbed his hand. “Philip Clarke.”</p>  <p id = > John smiled and said, “Mr. Clarke, please come with me.”</p>  <p id = > He led Philip and Agnes to a table and personally brewed two cups of tea. He put them in front of both of them. “Freshly made Tieguanyin.”</p>  <p id = > After he sat down, John rubbed his hands together. “I heard from Jude that you need ready stock cars?”</p>  <p id = > Philip nodded and said, “Yes, I need 100 motorcycles for my staff.”</p>  <p id = > John was taken aback. “100? Ready stock?”</p>  <p id = > Philip took a sip of his tea and said, “Yeah, I need 100. However, I don’t think you have that many here…”</p>  <p id = > John was smart, if not, he would not be the manager. He gritted his teeth and said, “If you need them, I can get you 100 this week, Mr. Clarke.”</p>  <p id = > This was a huge business!</p>  <p id = > An astronomical business!</p>  <p id = > He did not dare to dilly-dally.</p>  <p id = > “One week?” Philip was disappointed.</p>  <p id = > “Yes, I can get you 100 in a week,” John said and nodded seriously.</p>  <p id = > A lot of shops would not have this ability, but John was different.</p>  <p id = > First, he was the manager.</p>  <p id = > Second, this was a transaction that involved up to ten million!</p>  <p id = > The other shops would have to cooperate.</p>  <p id = > “No, I need them now. If you can get me 100 today, I’ll take them. A week is too slow. You should know we’re a delivery company. We can’t wait for even one second. The customers will complain if we’re slow.”</p>  <p id = > When Philip said that, John was shocked.</p>  <p id = > Today? So fast?</p>  <p id = > Wait!</p>  <p id = > Delivery company?</p>  <p id = > F*ck!</p>  <p id = > Delivery people usually used battery-powered bikes. Mr. Clarke was insane!</p>  <p id = > He was buying BMW motorcycles for his staff to deliver food!</p>  <p id = > Very rich!</p>  <p id = > He was a nouveau riche indeed!</p>                      <h2 id =chapter-61 > Chapter 61</h2> <p id = > Agnes’ expression changed. How much money did Philip have?</p>  <p id = > “How many can you get today?”</p>  <p id = > “Um… I have to try.”</p>  <p id = > John trembled. However, he was fueled with motivation at the same time.</p>  <p id = > If he managed to get this business, he would definitely be the best sales representative this year!</p>  <p id = > Ten minutes later.</p>  <p id = > “Mr. Clarke, the 100 BMW motorcycles you’re asking for comes up to a total of 28,570,000 bucks.” John walked over with his bill. He had already contacted the other shops and got them to deliver the bikes today.</p>  <p id = > Philip looked at the time and took out his card for the salesperson. “Take my card.”</p>  <p id = > George had given him this card when they were at the dessert shop last time.</p>  <p id = > He said there was 100 billion inside. He could use it however he wanted.</p>  <p id = > This was the first asset the family gave Philip.</p>  <p id = > To be honest, 100 billion bucks was nothing to him.</p>  <p id = > Before this, he saw his family mining for gold and diamonds in Africa and South America.</p>  <p id = > John was still in shock. He grabbed the card while being in a daze. He asked suddenly, “Are you not going to take a loan?”</p>  <p id = > Huh?</p>  <p id = > This time, Philip was the one who was shocked.</p>  <p id = > “Take a loan? Why should I? I have the money,” Philip said.</p>  <p id = > Nouveau riche!</p>  <p id = > This was a truly rich man!</p>  <p id = > He was buying 100 BMW motorcycles just like this.</p>  <p id = > After John swiped the card and Philip signed the contract, the former finally came back to his senses. This man really bought them!</p>  <p id = > ‘F*ck me! He really bought them! It’s a transaction of 30 million bucks!</p>  <p id = > ‘Oh my. That man is so willing to part with his money. He instantly bought 100!</p>  <p id = > ‘Are they hiring? I want to work for him.’</p>  <p id = > Under everyone’s envious gazes, Philip took over a bunch of keys from John and walked out the door with Agnes.</p>  <p id = > A bunch of car keys!</p>  <p id = > However, that was not all.</p>  <p id = > He would come back later to get the rest of them.</p>  <p id = > Behind them, the salespeople stood in one row and yelled in unison, “Congratulations Mr. Clarke for your 100 new BMW motorcycles.”</p>  <p id = > They were yelling very loudly. The staff in the Harley-Davidson specialty shop were amused by what they heard, so they ran out to see what was going on. Isabelle was one of them.</p>  <p id = > “F*ck me! BMW sold 100 bikes? That’s a 30 million transaction!”</p>  <p id = > “Who’s that rich person? Let me see.”</p>  <p id = > “Over there! He’s coming.”</p>  <p id = > The staff from Harley-Davidson stood at their shop and watched the people who were walking out from the BMW motorcycle specialty shop next door.</p>      <h2 id =chapter-62 > Chapter 62</h2> <p id = > The group of people was squeezing their heads to see what was going on. They wanted so badly to see who that nouveau riche was.</p>  <p id = > 100 BMW motorcycles!</p>  <p id = > That many would cost 20 to 30 million bucks!</p>  <p id = > “He’s here!” someone from the crowd yelled.</p>  <p id = > Everyone’s eyes were glued to the people who were walking out of the BMW shop.</p>  <p id = > The leader was a middle-aged man. They knew him. He was Manager Smith, the manager of the BMW motorcycle specialty shop.</p>  <p id = > He was walking with a young man. He was courteous and polite to him. He kept on nodding and bowing. He only stopped until he escorted the man into a BMW X8 that was already prepared prior.</p>  <p id = > This was the level of service for a huge client. They would get a car to drive them around.</p>  <p id = > The people in the Harley-Davidson shop did not even get to see the face of the nouveau riche before he got into the car and left.</p>  <p id = > There were too many people there, so they could not take a closer look.</p>  <p id = > “I can’t see him. Who is that? He’s so rich. Why didn’t he buy the bikes from us?” someone grumbled.</p>  <p id = > Indeed, 100 BMW motorcycles would easily cost a few million.</p>  <p id = > He was basically giving away money.</p>  <p id = > “I remember now. Is it the one who we chased out just now? Didn’t he want to buy 100 Harleys?” someone said loudly.</p>  <p id = > In an instant, everyone fell silent.</p>  <p id = > Isabelle’s face fell. She only came back to her senses when the car drove away. She yelled, “How is that possible? How would that person be able to afford 100 BMW motorcycles? Stop guessing. If he could buy 100 bikes, I, Isabelle Ford, will kowtow and apologize to him!”</p>  <p id = > Isabelle was going all the way with that statement.</p>  <p id = > She had no choice. She did not want to embarrass herself.</p>  <p id = > Plus, that poor man who wanted to buy 100 Harleys just now would not be able to afford those.</p>  <p id = > No way!</p>  <p id = > “Yeah, I support Isabelle. You guys were not around when it happened. His clothing was so shabby-looking. If he really had the money to buy 100 BMWs, why didn’t he buy from us?”</p>  <p id = > The salesperson stood next to Isabelle and supported her.</p>  <p id = > However, they forgot that they were the ones who kicked him out.</p>  <p id = > Everyone started laughing and making sarcastic remarks.</p>  <p id = > After the crowd dispersed, they went back to do their own things.</p>  <p id = > However, Isabelle felt horrible. After all, it was 100 BMWs. Their neighbor must be hanging up a banner to celebrate right now.</p>  <p id = > No, she had to go and ask about this. A nouveau riche like this might come to buy a Harley one day when he was happy.</p>  <p id = > With that thought, Isabelle went to the BMW motorbike specialty shop.</p>  <p id = > Of course, she would not go in. She would just wait at the entrance.</p>  <p id = > She knew the buyer would come back to get his bikes. After all, BMW would not deliver 100 bikes here instantly.</p>  <p id = > She was standing at the only road that led to the shop. She would definitely be able to spot that nouveau riche from here.</p>  <p id = > She only had one chance. She had to grasp it tightly.</p>  <p id = > At this moment, a sweet voice came from behind her.</p>  <p id = > “Belle, what are you doing?”</p>  <p id = > Isabelle turned around and saw her cousin, Ruby. She was with her friends when they walked over, the smell of their perfumes lingering in the air.</p>  <p id = > Her friends were dressed very provocatively and stylishly.</p>  <p id = > Nine out of ten men would turn around to look at them when they walked past.</p>  <p id = > Plus, her friends were not too bad. They had nice bodies and were not stingy in showing the world what their mothers gave them.</p>  <p id = > “Miss Isabelle.”</p>  <p id = > The other girls greeted. They all knew each other.</p>  <p id = > “It’s fine. I’m just waiting for someone,” Isabelle smiled and said. “Why are you so free today?”</p>  <p id = > Ruby grabbed Isabelle’s arms coquettishly and said, “My birthday is in a few days. I came here to invite you to a meal.”</p>  <p id = > Isabelle rolled her eyes at her and said, “Sure, I’ll go.”</p>  <p id = > “You have to bring some rich men over. My friends are in their ‘window period’. They’re desperate,” Ruby said gleefully.</p>  <p id = > Then, the gang chatted with Isabelle for a long while.</p>   <h2 id =chapter-63 > Chapter 63</h2> <p id = > Ruby was impatient. She asked while looking around, “Belle, who are you waiting for?”</p>  <p id = > “A nouveau riche. Do you see that banner? He bought 100 BMW bikes for 30 million.”</p>  <p id = > When Isabelle said this, she could not help but feel envious.</p>  <p id = > Why could she not meet someone rich like that?</p>  <p id = > “What? 100? 30 million?” Ruby’s eyes were wide from shock. Her mouth was wide open too. One could fit two eggs into her mouth.</p>  <p id = > “Isabelle, is that true?”</p>  <p id = > “Wow. What a rich man. Why didn’t I come here earlier?”</p>  <p id = > “No way. I’m waiting for him here too. Maybe he’ll take a fancy to me?”</p>  <p id = > The few girls started chattering. At the same time, they did not forget to take out their makeup bags to touch up their faces.</p>  <p id = > They were acting like they were going on a blind date.</p>  <p id = > The only downside to this was that the wind was strong, so there was a lot of dust particles in the air.</p>  <p id = > However, they did not care.</p>  <p id = > There was a nouveau riche who could buy 100 BMW bikes with 30 million bucks. As long as they could get their hands on him, they would not mind eating dust out here.</p>  <p id = > Isabelle shook her head helplessly when she saw their excited faces.</p>  <p id = > Was she not just like them?</p>  <p id = > It would be enough for her to meet such a rich person in her life even if it was just one time.</p>  <p id = > Ruby kept looking around. She wanted to barge into the shop and ask about the man’s background.</p>  <p id = > If possible, she did not mind dumping that coward, Howard, aside.</p>  <p id = > “Belle, why didn’t he buy with you guys if he’s so rich? Doesn’t your shop specialize in selling bikes like these?” Ruby asked weakly.</p>  <p id = > Isabelle shook her head and smiled bitterly. “If I knew, I wouldn’t be waiting here.”</p>  <p id = > Then, she thought of something. She scoffed before saying, “Right, let me tell you guys something hilarious.”</p>  <p id = > When they heard that there was gossip, the girls lifted their ears and listened carefully. They were like baby birds who were waiting for their mother to feed them. They asked impatiently, “What’s so funny? Look at you laughing away.”</p>  <p id = > “Yeah, tell us, Isabelle.”</p>  <p id = > Isabelle had successfully elicited the girls’ curiosity.</p>  <p id = > “You have no idea. This morning, a man came to our shop to buy bikes as well. He said he wanted 100 Harleys! I was shocked, so I thought to myself, ‘Are we having a huge client today?’ However, we don’t have 100 bikes. We only have 32. So, I told him that honestly, and guess what he said?”</p>  <p id = > “What happened next? Tell us!” The girls’ eyes were wide from anxiousness.</p>  <p id = > “I said we only have 32. That man looked disappointed and said, ‘Just 32?’ With that tone, I knew he never wanted to buy them. If you were really rich, you’d just say it’s fine if we don’t have 100. However, did you know that man was wearing a pair of white-washed jeans and had stubbles all over his face? I was furious. He was clearly not right in the head and was trying to cause trouble in our shop, so I kicked him out.”</p>  <p id = > When Isabelle said that, she still looked mad.</p>  <p id = > “No way. A person like that still exists?”</p>  <p id = > “I got it. That person must have seen that someone bought 100 BMW bikes, so he purposely went to your shop to pretend to buy too. How cheap!”</p>  <p id = > “Wow, how embarrassing. That man is the scum of society.”</p>  <p id = > “If I were him, I would not want to live anymore.”</p>  <p id = > “Never mind. He’s just crazy. Let’s not talk about this.” Isabelle smiled. “Right, Ruby, where are we going for your birthday?”</p>  <p id = > “Dunhuang Restaurant,” Ruby smiled and answered.</p>  <p id = > The girls started chatting again while waiting.</p>  <p id = > Everyone had their own plans in their hearts.</p>  <p id = > Isabelle did not want to chat anymore, so she kept looking in the direction of the junction.</p>  <p id = > Her heart was on that man who bought the 100 BMW bikes.</p>  <p id = > Humans were selfish. She hoped that the nouveau riche would take an interest in her.</p>  <p id = > If that were the case, she would not have to worry about her livelihood anymore.</p>  <p id = > “Right, Belle, what’s the name of that crazy guy who wanted to buy 100 Harleys? I want to know a guy like him. He’s so thick-skinned.”</p>  <p id = > Ruby joked and looked at the junction. “You have no idea. Howard’s friend, Philip, borrowed money from him not long ago and I scolded him. That man is the same as the guy you saw today. They’re all trash.”</p>  <p id = > When she thought about Philip, Ruby felt anger bubbling in her heart.</p>  <p id = > She had to ask Howard to stop contacting this friend of his.</p>  <p id = > “Never mind. Those people are just idiots. Why do you want to know him?” Isabelle laughed and scolded.</p>  <p id = > Before this, she heard Ruby complaining about Philip being scum. He kept borrowing money from everyone.</p>  <p id = > She heard he was depending on his wife and had a sick daughter.</p>  <p id = > She wondered how a person like that could bear to live on.</p>  <p id = > When they were waiting for that person, two figures appeared on the junction.</p>  <p id = > Isabelle’s eyes widened as a cold smile appeared on her lips. She said, “Girls, do you remember that crazy guy I mentioned just now? There, that’s him.”</p>   <h2 id =chapter-64 > Chapter 64</h2> <p id = > The girls looked over to where Isabelle was looking at and saw a shabby-looking man with a plastic bag. He was walking toward them.</p>  <p id = > After Ruby saw his face, she was taken aback. “Philip, what are you doing here?”</p>  <p id = > He was everywhere.</p>  <p id = > What was he doing here, though?</p>  <p id = > Philip was surprised. He did not expect to run into a b*tch like Ruby here.</p>  <p id = > When he thought about what had happened at the hotel, Philip felt horrible.</p>  <p id = > How should he describe this? Howard was his friend, and he did not know how to tell Howard about this.</p>  <p id = > He could only find a suitable opportunity.</p>  <p id = > “Philip?” Isabelle shrieked. A cold smile appeared on her lips, and her face was filled with sarcasm. “So he’s that Philip you were talking about. They’re the same kind of people indeed. They’re the same person!”</p>  <p id = > “What do you mean?” Ruby was confused.</p>  <p id = > “He’s the crazy guy I told you just now. That poor guy who went to our shop to buy 100 Harleys!” Isabelle mocked. Her face was filled with disdain and mockery.</p>  <p id = > “Dang! So he’s that idiot!”</p>  <p id = > “I didn’t expect to see someone like this. Seeing for oneself is better than hearing from many others!”</p>  <p id = > “He looks so shabby. Look at him. He’s even holding a plastic bag. Is he a garbage collector?”</p>  <p id = > In a flash, the women started to ridicule and jeer at him with malice.</p>  <p id = > Each and every one of them was arrogant and obnoxious. They were like rich ladies who just saw a scrap collector. They were feeling extremely pleased with themselves.</p>  <p id = > Ruby did not expect the man in Isabelle’s story to be Philip. Her eyes were filled with detest as she said, “How unexpected, Philip. You’re in this state now. How embarrassing.”</p>  <p id = > “What’s wrong with me?” Philip frowned, agitation evident on his face.</p>  <p id = > “Oh, you’re still pretending. How shameless. My cousin told us everything. There are not a lot of people like you now.” Ruby lifted her eyebrow and crossed her arms. She gave off an obnoxious vibe.</p>  <p id = > “Who are you? What are you talking about?” Agnes had been standing behind Philip the entire time. When she saw that the women were being rude to Philip, she went up and questioned them.</p>  <p id = > “Agnes, let’s go.” Philip felt helpless. He shook his head and did not want to pay attention to them. He turned around to leave.</p>  <p id = > “Pah!” Ruby spat. She looked at Philip in disdain.</p>  <p id = > At this moment, a familiar voice sounded.</p>  <p id = > “Hey, isn’t that the delivery uncle? What a coincidence!”</p>  <p id = > That voice sounded like nails on a chalkboard.</p>  <p id = > Philip turned around and saw three youngsters walking over to him arrogantly.</p>  <p id = > Lynn was there as well. She was following behind the two men.</p>  <p id = > Philip knew those men. They were Kyle and Jacob from the accident that night.</p>  <p id = > “F*ck me! Uncle, are you here to buy a bike? But you’re so poor. Can you even afford it?” Kyle approached Philip and patted his shoulder before saying sarcastically.</p>  <p id = > “My, my, Uncle. You ran away last time and I’ve been looking for you this entire time. I didn’t expect to run into you here. You won’t be able to run now.” It looked like Jacob was trying to block Philip from walking away.</p>  <p id = > This man was poor. He managed to escape last time, so they had to get some money from him this time.</p>  <p id = > Coincidentally, Harley-Davidson just launched their new model and they were short on cash.</p>  <p id = > However, Philip did not pay attention to them. They were just snotty kids.</p>  <p id = > He coldly looked at Lynn behind them and noticed that she did not dare to look at him. She must be feeling remorseful.</p>  <p id = > “Lynn, don’t you have anything to say to me?” Philip asked coldly.</p>  <p id = > Lynn crossed her arms and did not look at him. She said, “I… What do I have to say? It’s not entirely my fault. Your daughter was the one who ran all over the place. Can you blame me for that? Plus, we found her, so what else do you want?”</p>  <p id = > Lynn complained, her face cold.</p>  <p id = > She was not happy about Philip’s attitude toward her. How dare a spineless coward question her?</p>  <p id = > Damn it!</p>  <p id = > “Hey, what are you talking about? Are you trying to cause trouble? Do you believe that I’ll slap you? Do you believe that I’ll f*ck you up?” When Jacob saw that Lynn was feeling wronged, he was infuriated. Hence, he pushed Philip.</p>  <p id = > Lynn’s brother-in-law?</p>  <p id = > Sorry, to him, he was just a piece of trash who was living off a woman.</p>  <p id = > Coincidentally, Isabelle, Ruby, and the other women were watching what was going on. They scoffed and said, “Look, he’s just a useless bum yet he’s talking big about buying 100 Harleys. I’ve never seen anyone like him.”</p>  <p id = > When Kyle and his gang heard that, they started guffawing after being stunned.</p>  <p id = > “What the hell? 100 Harleys?” Kyle laughed and pointed at Philip sarcastically.</p>  <p id = > He was impressed by how he blew his own horn.</p>  <p id = > Isabelle smiled coldly and said, “Yeah, he came to our shop this morning and said he wanted to buy 100 Harleys. I kicked him out in the end.”</p>  <p id = > In the next second, the crowd started howling.</p>  <p id = > Lynn could not hold in her laughter as well. She lifted her eyebrow and said in disdain, “Trash will always be trash. I don’t know why my cousin hasn’t divorced you yet.”</p>  <p id = > Then…</p>  <p id = > Philip opened his mouth calmly, “Who said I can’t afford them? I’ve already bought them…”</p>            <h2 id =chapter-65 > Chapter 65</h2> <p id = > “Hahaha! I’m going to die from laughter.” Isabelle interrupted Philip and was smirking coldly. “Are you saying you’re the one who bought 100 BMW bikes? Why don’t you take a piss and look at your reflection? How dare you blow your own horn here?”</p>  <p id = > When Kyle heard that, he said, “BMW sold 100 bikes?”</p>  <p id = > At that moment, Isabelle told everyone about the mysterious nouveau riche who bought 100 BMW bikes.</p>  <p id = > After she said that, everyone was envious.</p>  <p id = > They had to know who this nouveau riche was.</p>  <p id = > Kyle smirked in disdain and said, “Uncle, you’re so shameless. If you’re the one who bought 100 BMW bikes, I, Kyle Lyon, will change my last name to yours!”</p>  <p id = > “Me too!” Jacob added while chuckling.</p>  <p id = > In their eyes, Philip was just a joke. This man’s life was too lamentable. He was living his life through imaginations.</p>  <p id = > However, things were not as they expected.</p>  <p id = > Philip looked at the crowd coldly and said, “You’re Kyle Lyon and you’re Jacob Wells?”</p>  <p id = > “Why are you calling us, Dad?” Kyle puffed up his chest. He looked extremely obnoxious.</p>  <p id = > “I’m sorry, I don’t have such unfilial sons like you two,” Philip said calmly.</p>  <p id = > In an instant, Kyle and Jacob were stunned.</p>  <p id = > Was this guy sick of living?</p>  <p id = > Suddenly!</p>  <p id = > Philip opened the plastic bag he was holding and a bunch of BMW bike keys was displayed in front of everyone.</p>  <p id = > They were stunned.</p>  <p id = > Everyone was in shock.</p>  <p id = > Isabelle, Ruby, and the rest of the group were wide-eyed as their jaws dropped to the ground. They were speechless.</p>  <p id = > They were shocked to the core!</p>  <p id = > The entire bag of keys with the BMW logos was so dazzling.</p>  <p id = > Did he really buy 100 BMW bikes?</p>  <p id = > What the f*ck did this mean?</p>  <p id = > Why did he have the keys?</p>  <p id = > However.</p>  <p id = > In the next second, Ruby walked over and snatched away Philip’s bag. She smashed it to the ground and slapped him across the face. She pointed at his nose and yelled, “Have you not embarrassed yourself enough? You’re just delivering the keys and you’re feeling proud of yourself. Who gave you the courage to pretend to be that nouveau riche? How disgusting!”</p>  <p id = > In the next second, everyone had a sudden realization. They all started humiliating him.</p>  <p id = > “Damn. I thought he bought them. He’s just delivering the keys. You really can see all kinds of weird things if you live long enough.”</p>  <p id = > “How embarrassing. Was it worth it to put on an act? See, you’re being slapped now.”</p>  <p id = > “Lynn, your brother-in-law is really something else.”</p>  <p id = > Lynn was feeling helpless. She felt ashamed. She scolded while stomping her feet, “He’s not my brother-in-law! He’s just an idiot!”</p>  <p id = > Philip’s face was red. He did not see that slap coming.</p>  <p id = > Also, he was the one who bought the bikes. The keys were all here.</p>  <p id = > They did not believe him.</p>  <p id = > At that moment, he felt anger rising in his chest. His eyes went cold and he said in a low voice, “Ruby Ford, you’re asking for death.”</p>  <p id = > “Hehe, so what? You can’t accept this? I even resent that I dirtied my hand by slapping a person like you.” Ruby looked at him with her chin. She looked very arrogant.</p>  <p id = > Everyone was watching as the drama unfolded. They were feeling pleased.</p>  <p id = > Smack!</p>  <p id = > Agnes had been watching what was going on. She could not take it anymore. She walked over and slapped Ruby across the face. She said coldly, “You presumptuous woman! How dare you slap him?”</p>  <p id = > Ruby’s face turned to one side, and she clutched her face. She stared at Agnes with wide eyes and shrieked, “How dare you slap me? Girls, get her! Throw her on the street naked!”</p>  <p id = > Chaos! It was utter chaos!</p>  <p id = > Suddenly!</p>  <p id = > A middle-aged man ran over from the BMW motorcycle specialty shop. He yelled loudly, “Stop it! What are you doing?”</p>  <p id = > John had just come back from delivering the bikes when he saw what was happening. His eyes almost fell out of his skull.</p>  <p id = > That was the nouveau riche who bought 30 million worth of bikes!</p>  <p id = > If he was being attacked in front of his shop, his transaction would be voided!</p>  <p id = > Smack!</p>  <p id = > John ran over while drenched with sweat. He did not even ask what was going on. He just slapped Ruby a few times across the face when he got there.</p>  <p id = > “You mad woman! How dare you be so rude to Mr. Clarke? You’re really looking for death!”</p>  <p id = > John was like an erupting volcano. His entire body was burning. He was beyond furious!</p>    <h2 id =chapter-66 > Chapter 66</h2> <p id = > “Stop f*cking standing there! Get those mad women!”</p>  <p id = > John was vehement. He roared at the salespeople at the entrance who was looking at them.</p>  <p id = > After that, he walked over and grabbed Ruby’s arm. Then, he did a body slam.</p>  <p id = > Yes!</p>  <p id = > A body slam!</p>  <p id = > Bam!</p>  <p id = > After a scream, Ruby was thrown to the ground. Her face was facing downward, completely covered in dirt.</p>  <p id = > The most important thing was that there was a puddle on the ground. Ruby’s face was being pressed into the puddle.</p>  <p id = > It was such a tragic sight.</p>  <p id = > The salespeople saw that their manager going insane, so they rushed out and pressed everyone including Isabelle to the ground without saying anything.</p>  <p id = > They needed to use violence to deal with these b*tches.</p>  <p id = > In an instant, the scene was in chaos. Those women who were dressed glamorously were all having intimate contact with the ground. Their bodies were covered with dirt. They did not look like the flirtatious women they were before.</p>  <p id = > Lynn and the gang wanted to run, but unfortunately, they were being pressed on the ground as well.</p>  <p id = > Kyle and Jacob wanted to fight back, but after they were punched a few times, they became more obedient.</p>  <p id = > Lynn’s situation was slightly better. She had squatted down immediately, so nothing happened to her.</p>  <p id = > “F*ck! You’re all insane! How dare you touch me! I’ll kill all of you! I know Tiger! Let go of me!”</p>  <p id = > Ruby was being pressed on the ground by John. Her face was covered with dirty water. She was spitting out dirt and water from her mouth. She let out a loud shriek.</p>  <p id = > She was supposed to be a goddess who radiated grace and charm.</p>  <p id = > Now, however, she was being beaten and pressed on the ground. No man would be able to stand this sight.</p>  <p id = > “Let me go, you disgusting pigs!”</p>  <p id = > “How dare you touch me? I’ll ask Tiger and his gang to destroy your shop!”</p>  <p id = > “Ruby, go get more people!”</p>  <p id = > The girls did not care about their images anymore. They were all struggling on the ground.</p>  <p id = > “This is what you get for being rude to Mr. Clarke.”</p>  <p id = > John yelled and let go of Ruby. Then, he smiled charmingly and nodded to Philip respectfully, “Mr. Clarke, you’re back. Everything’s ready.”</p>  <p id = > After he said that, John waved his hand and seven to eight tall female salespeople walked over. They were smiling flirtatiously while walking over with top-grade boxes stamped with BMW logos.</p>  <p id = > Then, they opened the boxes.</p>  <p id = > There were 10 BMW keys meticulously placed in each box.</p>  <p id = > They looked dazzling under the sun.</p>  <p id = > “Mr. Clarke, the remaining 60 keys are all here. Do you need me to take you to see the bikes?” John was smiling respectfully. His face was blossoming like a flower.</p>  <p id = > Isabelle, Ruby, and the rest of the gang were stunned by what they were seeing.</p>  <p id = > After they got up from the ground, they did not even care to tidy themselves up. When they were about to start fighting, they saw the sight before them.</p>  <p id = > They were stunned.</p>  <p id = > Six top-grade boxes. Inside the boxes, there were 60 keys for the BMW bikes.</p>  <p id = > Plus, these were all for Philip!</p>  <p id = > Impossible!</p>  <p id = > Ruby was the first one to reject this. She rushed over and shrieked, “You’re wrong! You must be! How can he afford these? He even wanted to borrow money from my boyfriend. He’s just a penniless fool!”</p>  <p id = > Ruby lost her mind. She started to make an unreasonable scene and was being deliberately provocative.</p>  <p id = > She pushed those female salespeople and pushed one of the boxes to the ground. The keys scattered all over the floor.</p>  <p id = > Her face was covered in dirt and water. She was like a monkey that had lost its mind. She pointed at Philip maliciously and yelled, “Impossible! You’re not the one who bought these. No way! You must have fooled them. It must be! Say, who do those keys belong to? Tell me!”</p>  <p id = > Ruby could not stand this.</p>  <p id = > Isabelle was also so shocked that she was speechless.</p>  <p id = > However, what she saw was real.</p>  <p id = > He was the one who bought them!</p>  <p id = > Suddenly, there was a loud cry.</p>  <p id = > Isabelle broke down and started wailing. She had kicked a nouveau riche out herself. He wanted to buy 100 Harleys!</p>  <p id = > She had sinned!</p>  <p id = > Why was she so stupid? Why did she look down on him?</p>  <p id = > That was a 30 million transaction. Her commission would have gone up to a million bucks!</p>  <p id = > “Yeah, it’s definitely not him! You must have made a mistake!”</p>  <p id = > Isabelle fell apart. She could not believe this. She grabbed John and shrieked while sobbing.</p>  <p id = > Smack!</p>  <p id = > John was annoyed. He waved his hand and slapped Isabelle and Ruby. Those two mad women’s brains started buzzing after getting slapped.</p>  <p id = > Then, he pointed at Isabelle’s nose and scolded angrily, “Isabelle, stop acting crazy in front of me. Remember how you hopped to Harley-Davidson? You should know that better than anyone. I’m being kind for not settling scores with you. However, I have to thank you today. You’re the one who gave us such a big client.”</p>  <p id = > When he said that, John looked pleased.</p>  <p id = > On the other hand, Isabelle was shaking her head while having an emotional breakdown. She screamed, “No way! How does he have so much money for bikes?”</p>      <h2 id =chapter-67 > Chapter 67</h2> <p id = > She refused to believe this.</p>  <p id = > Ruby did not believe this.</p>  <p id = > Kyle and Jacob did not believe this either.</p>  <p id = > Lynn also did not believe this.</p>  <p id = > She knew what kind of person her brother-in-law was. He was just a spineless coward who lived off of a woman.</p>  <p id = > He even borrowed money from everyone to cure his daughter. How would a man like him have 30 million to buy 100 BMW bikes?</p>  <p id = > Where did he get the money?</p>  <p id = > However, at this moment, Philip put his hand behind his back and said indifferently, “I never said I had no money. You’re the one who put a label on me. So what if I have no money? So what if I do? Everyone only has one life and this is the first time everyone became human. There’s no reason for me to submit to everyone else because I have no money nor power. Also, there’s no reason to bully someone because one’s rich or powerful. I didn’t ask you to be kind, I just wanted to tell you some principles.”</p>  <p id = > Philip’s voice was resonating.</p>  <p id = > Now that everyone’s eyes were on him, his words were amplified even more.</p>  <p id = > Philip looked at everyone and said with a cold smile, “I, Philip Clarke, has a lot of money. If you’re not convinced, then you should just stay on the floor. If you’re not happy with me, I have all the money in the world to make you kneel on the floor and lick my feet.”</p>  <p id = > He sounded so domineering.</p>  <p id = > He had sounded so righteous in his speech earlier, but in the next moment, he became overbearing.</p>  <p id = > Everyone was shocked.</p>  <p id = > Especially Isabelle and her gang. They were looking at Philip with complicated eyes.</p>  <p id = > Philip was enjoying their gazes on him. They looked like they were in fear and yet, they were unconvinced at the same time.</p>  <p id = > At that moment, a horde of BMW bikes sounded loudly from the junction.</p>  <p id = > The riders stopped and parked the bikes. Then, they took off their helmets and got down. They were lined up in neat rows.</p>  <p id = > The ones in the shop were also being driven out. They all stopped at the plaza with the engines rumbling.</p>  <p id = > 100!</p>  <p id = > There were 100 bikes!</p>  <p id = > It was such a sight. Everyone took in a deep breath.</p>  <p id = > Several passersby stopped and took pictures of this.</p>  <p id = > Philip said to John, “Drove them to Arc de Triumph Hotel. We’ll be having dinner there tonight.”</p>  <p id = > After that, John nodded and took out his walkie-talkie. He announced to the drivers that were called in from all over the city.</p>  <p id = > “Hurry, Arc de Triumph Hotel, now!”</p>  <p id = > Vroom!</p>  <p id = > The 100 BMW bikes drove down the street with their engines rumbling loudly.</p>  <p id = > Isabelle and the gang sat on the ground lifelessly like their spines had been taken out after Philip left. They started wailing loudly without caring about their images.</p>  <p id = > Ruby bit her red lips fiercely. Blood started seeping out from the wound. She looked at Isabelle with red eyes. “Belle, do you believe that he’s that nouveau riche?”</p>  <p id = > Isabelle said while smiling bitterly, “What else can I believe in? They’ve already driven the bikes away.”</p>  <p id = > She knew she was in deep trouble. She had kicked out such a big client. A discharge letter would definitely be waiting for her.</p>  <p id = > At this moment, John walked over. He patted the dust on his suit in a pleased manner and towered over the wan and sallow-looking Isabelle. “Thank you.”</p>  <p id = > That one statement broke Isabelle’s last defense.</p>  <p id = > However, Ruby still refused to believe this. She got up and grabbed John. She asked, “I want to know why he bought so many bikes.”</p>  <p id = > John thought Ruby was good looking, but she was too snobbish. He said coldly, “Mr. Clarke has a delivery company. He’s changing bikes for his staff. Mr. Clarke is so generous. From now on, all of the delivery guys in Riverdale will be riding the BMW bikes from our shop. How f*cking flashy.”</p>  <p id = > After he said that, John guffawed and left.</p>  <p id = > Ruby was stunned for a while. Then, she stomped her feet and screeched, “F*ck! Philip Clarke!</p>  <p id = > “He lied to all of us! He did not buy the bikes! His company is just changing their bikes! He’s pretending to be the boss to flex on us!”</p>  <p id = > Ruby was screaming and shrieking to release her anger.</p>  <p id = > She did not believe that Philip had ten million bucks. She figured that Philip’s boss wanted to change the bikes in his company and he was just here on behalf of his boss.</p>  <p id = > Her friend started gathering around. They were all in disbelief. After they understood what was going on, it was like they were being injected with chicken blood. They pointed and hurled abuses at the figure that was long gone.</p>  <p id = > Lynn and the guys were still there. When they heard that, they let out sighs of relief.</p>  <p id = > “F*ck me. Lynn, your brother-in-law really is something else. He’s a whole new level of pretentiousness.” Kule nodded and smirked coldly.</p>  <p id = > “He’s just a good-for-nothing!” Lynn hurled some abuses at him resentfully before leaving with Kyle and Jacob.</p>  <p id = > Her brother-in-law was so devious!</p>  <p id = > On this side, Ruby took out her phone and made a call. Then, she started sobbing and saying coquettishly, “Tiger, where are you? You have to help me. Sob, sob, sob…”</p>  <h2 id =chapter-68 > Chapter 68</h2> <p id = > On the other end of the phone, a boorish male voice roared, “Which f*cker dared to offend you? Do they want to die?”</p>  <p id = > “Tiger, you have to stand up for me. Sob…” Ruby looked so pitiful when she cried.</p>  <p id = > “Okay, stop crying. Tell me who that is and I’ll f*ck him up for you!”</p>  <p id = > On the other end of the phone, a heavily built man and a few of his men were eating at Jade Pavilion.</p>  <p id = > It was none other than Tiger. At that moment, he was shirtless.</p>  <p id = > Tiger was a hot-tempered person, so he was extremely irritable.</p>  <p id = > Ruby was his lover. Anyone who crossed Ruby would be slapping Tiger across the face.</p>  <p id = > He had to find that person!</p>  <p id = > He had to make that person know that no one could touch his woman. He did not care who that was!</p>  <p id = > Half an hour later, Ruby and the girls came to Jade Pavilion.</p>  <p id = > Ruby still looked wretched at that moment. Although she redid her makeup, she also added some fake bruises on the corner of her eyes and lips.</p>  <p id = > When they saw each other, she was like a sticky carp. She slid coquettishly into Tiger’s arms. She cried, “Tiger, look! He hit me until I became like this. You have to stand up for me!”</p>  <p id = > Tiger saw the bruises on Ruby’s face and flew into a blind rage. He slammed his hand down on the table, making all the wine glasses jump. The wine glasses then fell off the table. He yelled, “F*ck! Who the f*ck is so unbridled? Did you not tell him that you’re my woman?”</p>  <p id = > Tiger was livid.</p>  <p id = > Whoever it was, they ruined such a beautiful face. How could he not be mad?</p>  <p id = > This was not about the slapping, but it was about honor.</p>  <p id = > Ruby sobbed and said, “I told him, but he s-said…”</p>  <p id = > Ruby pretended to stammer from fear.</p>  <p id = > Tiger frowned and roared, “What did he say? Tell me!”</p>  <p id = > “He said, ‘Tiger who? He’s just a paper tiger. If he has the guts, tell him to come find me and I’ll remove his teeth,’” Ruby said.</p>  <p id = > She had prepared the script while she was on her way here. She was making this all up.</p>  <p id = > Her friends all nodded and chimed in.</p>  <p id = > “Yeah, Tiger. That guy was looking down on you.”</p>  <p id = > “You have to get him! His name is Philip Clarke.”</p>  <p id = > “I know where they are. They went to Arc de Triumph Hotel.”</p>  <p id = > The women were chattering non-stop.</p>  <p id = > Tiger’s chest was filled with rage and he had nowhere to release it. He got up and kicked the chair he was sitting on. Then, he roared, “F*ck! I, Tiger Zander, have been with Theo for seven to eight years and this is the first time I’ve come across someone who looks down on me! Arc de Triumph Hotel, right? You lot, get the boys. We’re going to riot! Get that blind fool back here for daddy!”</p>  <p id = > Of course, Tiger did not know who Philip was.</p>  <p id = > Mr. Clarke?</p>  <p id = > Tiger only knew Mr. Clarke as Mr. Clarke and not by his full name.</p>  <p id = > Plus, even if he knew that Mr. Clarke was Philip, there were so many Philip Clarkes in the world.</p>  <p id = > A roar broke out in the private room.</p>  <p id = > Seven to eight men in the private room got up and barged out angrily.</p>  <p id = > Tiger would not go there personally. He would just make a fool out of himself if he did.</p>  <p id = > Of course, he would ask his men to take care of something as minor as this.</p>  <p id = > Ruby could not hide the cold smirk on her face when she saw Tiger being so furious. She mumbled in her heart, ‘Philip Clarke, you’re dead meat!’</p>  <p id = > ‘How dare you cross me. I’ll pull out your nerves and skin you alive!’</p>  <p id = > Back to Wynn. When she got to the office in the morning, she felt that something was off.</p>  <p id = > It was as if everyone was looking at her and mumbling softly about her.</p>  <p id = > When chairman Derrick called for a meeting, Wynn knew for sure that something big was happening.</p>  <p id = > “Did you hear about that? Marketing department’s manager, Gavin Zach, has been fired!”</p>  <p id = > “What? Mr. Zach was fired? No way! He has been working here for so many years. Why was he fired?”</p>  <p id = > “You have no idea, right? I heard he offended someone important in Celestial Club and was beaten half-dead on the spot. He’s still in the hospital. Plus, that person stated that if anyone dares to hire Gavin, there will be only one result—they should just wait for their company to go bankrupt.”</p>  <p id = > “Dang! Who’s that? Why are they so ostentatious? Tell us!”</p>  <p id = > Everyone in the office was gossiping non-stop.</p>  <p id = > Wynn heard most of it and was suspicious.</p>  <p id = > At the same time, she believed that the only reason Philip could save her was because of that important person.</p>  <p id = > She was even more determined to know about that person.</p>  <p id = > However, it was unfortunate that no one knew about that mysterious person.</p>  <p id = > Despite that, the more mysterious that person was, the more Wynn wanted to know.</p>  <p id = > Who could that be?</p>  <p id = > Wynn was in her office. However, her head was somewhere else the entire day. After pondering for a long while, she decided to call and ask Philip.</p>  <p id = > “Hello, honey. What’s wrong?” A familiar voice sounded on the other side of the phone.</p>  <p id = > Wynn was hesitant. She bit her lip and asked, “Philip, I want to ask you about how you saved me from Celestial Club.”</p>  <p id = > It was difficult for her to put that into words.</p>  <p id = > After all, she was almost raped by Rand Turner because she wanted to take on his business.</p>  <p id = > Wynn was still slightly traumatized from that.</p>  <p id = > Philip and Agnes had arrived at Arc de Triumph Hotel. He felt that something was amiss when Wynn asked him that.</p>  <p id = > He decided to lie. “The boss of the club had some misunderstanding with someone that day. So, I rushed in and saved you without even thinking.”</p>  <p id = > “That’s all?” Wynn asked curiously. It was obvious that she did not buy it.</p>  <p id = > “What’s wrong? Do you not believe me?” Philip laughed and asked.</p>  <p id = > Wynn frowned and said after pondering for a moment, “Alright, I got it.”</p>  <p id = > After she said that, she hung up the phone. She started at her documents and started to space out.</p>  <p id = > Even though that person had not come to save her, it was all thanks to him that she was saved.</p>  <p id = > Who was that mysterious person?</p>       <h2 id =chapter-69 > Chapter 69</h2> <p id = > Derrick was sitting in the middle of the meeting room. He looked at his staff and coughed. Then, he said, “I’m sure you’ve all heard of Mr. Zach’s dismissal. Don’t make random guesses. The reason he can’t stay as the general manager of the marketing department is because of his health. So, I’ve decided that Wynn should be the general manager of the marketing department of our company.”</p>  <p id = > After he said that, applause sounded in the meeting room.</p>  <p id = > Wynn was still spacing out. She was thinking about that mysterious man. She only came back to her senses when the person next to her poked her. She stood up hurriedly and said gratefully, “Thank you for trusting me, Mr. Hall. I’ll do my best.”</p>  <p id = > Mr. Hall had already told her about the promotion earlier on.</p>  <p id = > Wynn had already mentally prepared herself.</p>  <p id = > After the meeting was dismissed, Wynn went back to her office. After a while, Rose walked in angrily and shrieked unreasonably, “Wynn Johnston! Why? You vixen! You must have slept with him! If not, how did you become the general manager? That’s my position, you b*tch!”</p>  <p id = > Rose was angry. All her time and effort to flatter her way to the top had been for nothing.</p>  <p id = > Plus, she even lost her job now.</p>  <p id = > Human resources told her that she was fired.</p>  <p id = > The first thing she did was to barge into Wynn’s office to create a ruckus.</p>  <p id = > Wynn looked at her indifferently and said coldly, “Rose, don’t you know what you did? You have no right to tell me whether I deserve this position or not. Get out now!”</p>  <p id = > Wynn was extremely frustrated.</p>  <p id = > “Oh? Your tail is starting to show after you got promoted to general manager, huh? You b*tch! You’re a homewrecker!”</p>  <p id = > Rose did not care anymore. She started yelling and shrieking to make trouble for no reason. When she was pulled out from the office, she was still trying to create a ruckus in the office that was only a few hundred square feet. “Let me tell you all, Wynn Johnston is a b*tch! She sleeps with the clients whenever she goes out to talk business. She’s a gigantic wh*re!</p>  <p id = > “Ah! Let go of me! Let go!”</p>  <p id = > “Wynn! Just you wait! I’ll never forgive you!”</p>  <p id = > Wynn grabbed her bag and took a bus to Celestial Club after Rose was dragged out.</p>  <p id = > She wanted to know who that mysterious person was.</p>  <p id = > However, when she got to Celestial Club, she found that it had been demolished.</p>  <p id = > There were a few bulldozers at the scene. Some workers were going on about their jobs.</p>  <p id = > “Hello, can I help you?”</p>  <p id = > Wynn turned around and saw a tall and sexy woman strutting over to her.</p>  <p id = > She was perfect. She had the perfect body and her skin was flawless. From her smile, one could tell that she was a kind, respectful, and stylish woman.</p>  <p id = > It was Anna.</p>  <p id = > “Miss Johnston, why are you here?” When Anna saw Wynn’s face, she asked curiously.</p>  <p id = > Wynn was shocked. That woman knew her.</p>  <p id = > “Do you know me?” Wynn asked.</p>  <p id = > “Of course, Miss Johnston. My boss told us specifically to take good care of you.” Anna smiled, her eyes turning into little crescents. She looked like she had been kissed by the spring breeze.</p>  <p id = > Wynn’s heart trembled when she asked, “Is it the boss who saved me that night?”</p>  <p id = > Anna smiled and nodded. “Miss Johnston, you’re hilarious. Do you not know our boss?”</p>  <p id = > Anna was curious. Were she and Mr. Clarke not married to each other?</p>  <p id = > Wynn smiled. How would she know that person? She never even saw what they looked like.</p>  <p id = > “Um, can you give me your boss’ number? I want to thank him in person,” Wynn stammered.</p>  <p id = > Anna pressed her lips together. She was puzzled. However, she still agreed. “Of course.”</p>  <p id = > After she said that, she took out her phone and found Mr. Clarke’s number.</p>  <p id = > Wynn looked over and saw that it was an unknown number. However, the last four digits of the number made her eyes brighten. 0513! It was her birthday!</p>  <p id = > Was it a coincidence?</p>  <p id = > After hesitating, Wynn called the number. She was extremely nervous.</p>  <p id = > “I walked past your world and I’ve lived through it when it was in full bloom. Please go forward and don’t turn back. I’ll be the one waiting for you at the end.”</p>  <p id = > The ringtone!</p>  <p id = > It was her favorite song.</p>  <p id = > Plus, it was the song Philip sang to her when he proposed to her.</p>  <p id = > Was it another coincidence?</p>  <p id = > Wynn started to feel nervous all of a sudden. She kept seeing Philip’s face in her brain.</p>  <p id = > Was it him?</p>  <p id = > At the same time, Philip was standing at the entrance of Arc de Triumph Hotel. Suddenly, his phone rang.</p>  <p id = > He touched his pocket and took out a phone. No, it was not this one.</p>  <p id = > It was the other one.</p>  <p id = > He took it out again and looked at the caller ID. ‘Honey.’</p>  <p id = > Suddenly, Philip was stunned. His eyes grew big.</p>  <p id = > How was this possible?</p>  <p id = > She had never called this number before!</p>  <p id = > He only saved her number in his contact list.</p>  <p id = > He never mentioned this number to Wynn before.</p>  <p id = > Plus, he only told this number to three people—George, Theo, and Anna.</p>  <p id = > The people who knew this number were the ones who knew about his identity!</p>  <p id = > How did Wynn find out about this number?</p>  <p id = > Was his identity exposed?</p>     <h2 id =chapter-70 > Chapter 70</h2> <p id = > Should he pick up the call?</p>  <p id = > Philip was confused. He called Agnes and told her what was going on. He said, “Muddle through this.”</p>  <p id = > Agnes nodded and motioned with her hands to signify ‘okay’. She answered the call gracefully, “Hello, who’s this?”</p>  <p id = > On the other side of the phone, Wynn was clearly shocked. She did not expect the other party to be a woman.</p>  <p id = > Plus, her voice sounded nice.</p>  <p id = > However, at the same time, she let out a sigh of relief. It was not him.</p>  <p id = > Had she been overthinking?</p>  <p id = > Hehe, right.</p>  <p id = > Would she not know what kind of person Philip was?</p>  <p id = > She pathetically came up with that illusion despite that.</p>  <p id = > “Hello, Mrs. Clarke. I am Wynn Johnston. Maybe you don’t know me, but I was saved in Celestial Club that day thanks to you.” Wynn had prepared a speech on how to thank her.</p>  <p id = > “Oh, it’s fine. I’m just happy to help. We’re all women, and I hate it when men force women to do dirty things,” Agnes said. She was skilled in making conversation.</p>  <p id = > As she said that, she glanced at Philip who was giving her a thumbs up.</p>  <p id = > Why was he hiding this from his wife?</p>  <p id = > “Um, Mrs. Clarke, do you have time? I want to treat you to a meal.” Wynn asked probingly. Then, she explained hurriedly, “Don’t worry. I just want to thank you.”</p>  <p id = > Agnes did not reply immediately. She looked at Philip and moved her lips slightly. She whispered, “She said she wants to treat you to a meal. Yes or no?”</p>  <p id = > Philip shook his head.</p>  <p id = > Agnes smiled and replied, “Alright, I’m a little busy recently. I’ll get in touch with you when I have time.”</p>  <p id = > Actually, Agnes did not even overthink it.</p>  <p id = > She thought Philip had fought with Wynn and they were having a cold war between themselves.</p>  <p id = > She wanted to help them make amends.</p>  <p id = > “Really? That’s great.” Wynn sounded happy.</p>  <p id = > “Yeah, I have something I need to take care of. I’m going to hang up now.” Agnes hung up the phone after she said that. She smiled at Philip and tilted her head. “How did I do?”</p>  <p id = > Philip’s face fell. Agnes was taking things into her own hands.</p>  <p id = > However, he could not say anything about that. He could only shake his head and sigh helplessly. “Never mind. Let’s just leave it this way. But please don’t make decisions for me in the future, okay? I can’t tell anyone about my identity yet, including Wynn.”</p>  <p id = > Agnes was shocked. She lost her train of thought instantly. She bowed and apologized. “Mr. Clarke, I… I thought you had a fight with Miss Johnston and that’s why…”</p>  <p id = > Agnes’ eyes were watery. She looked like she was extremely aggrieved.</p>  <p id = > Philip did not want to scold her anyway, so he smiled and said, “It’s fine. Just don’t do this again.”</p>  <p id = > Then, they turned around and walked into Arc de Triumph Hotel.</p>  <p id = > Tonight, Philip decided to treat the staff of his company to a meal as a reward.</p>  <p id = > When everyone got here, Philip downed his drink.</p>  <p id = > Everyone was curious about how Philip got so rich all of a sudden.</p>  <p id = > “Don’t look at me like that. I’m just a normal person. As for the money, they were left for me by my father. I’m still the old Philip even though I’m rich. We’re still friends.” Philip smiled.</p>  <p id = > “Philip, what are you talking about? You became rich and you bought our company for ten million bucks. I’ve never seen you spend money like this.”</p>  <p id = > “Right, but to be honest, you did such a good job of hiding it, Philip. Are you those secretly rich men who only appear in novels?”</p>  <p id = > His old colleagues laughed and said. They were hiding a great deal of flattery in their sentences.</p>  <p id = > They had no choice. When one became a dragon, millions would want to pay their respects.</p>  <p id = > If even a guy like Philip could become rich, why could they not?</p>  <p id = > However, this was reality.</p>  <p id = > Aside from flattery, they could not do anything else.</p>  <p id = > Before this, Philip had been poor, so they could talk freely. It was different now. They added more respect and flattery in their words.</p>  <p id = > Philip understood that and addressed this issue. “Alright guys, stop flattering me. Don’t you guys know what kind of person I am? Aside from Wilson who always targeted me, everyone else treated me quite well. I remember all of those. It has nothing to do with being rich or not. It’s just a word. I won’t forget about you guys because I have what I have right now. Also, I won’t treat you guys unfairly.</p>  <p id = > “So, today, aside from this meal, I also have some little presents for you guys.”</p>                <h2 id =chapter-71 > Chapter 71</h2> <p id = > Philip snapped his fingers.</p>  <p id = > After that, ten tall waitresses with slitted cheongsams walked into the private room in a single file.</p>  <p id = > They were all holding delicate BMW boxes in their hands.</p>  <p id = > When the boxes were opened, the BMW keys were displayed for everyone to see.</p>  <p id = > At this moment, everyone was stunned.</p>  <p id = > “F*ck me! What is this? BMW... keys? There’s about 100 of those. Philip, what are you doing? Are you changing your career to be a key maker?”</p>  <p id = > According to their knowledge of Philip, he would never buy 100 BMWs just because he was a nouveau riche.</p>  <p id = > However, he did spend ten million to buy the company and become the new boss.</p>  <p id = > The BMW keys, though… This could not be...</p>  <p id = > Suddenly, someone from the crowd sucked in a deep breath and yelled, “Gosh! Did you guys forget about the BMW bikes at the parking lot?”</p>  <p id = > At this moment, everyone sucked in a deep breath.</p>  <p id = > Right!</p>  <p id = > There were 100 BMW bikes in the parking lot.</p>  <p id = > They were still discussing heatedly. They were wondering which nouveau riche was hosting a biker party.</p>  <p id = > Was Philip the one who bought all of the bikes?</p>  <p id = > T-this was unbelievable!</p>  <p id = > “You’re right. I bought all 100 of the bikes,” Philip nodded and said nonchalantly.</p>  <p id = > Bzz!</p>  <p id = > Everyone was stunned.</p>  <p id = > “Philip, are you for real?” A lot of them were horrified.</p>  <p id = > “What’s wrong? I just bought presents for you guys. Plus, we’re delivery guys. We have to be fast, right? These babies will definitely be as fast as lightning!” Philip said.</p>  <p id = > A few of them had their eyes wide. They were staring at each other in disbelief.</p>  <p id = > “Philip, are you saying that from now on, we’ll be delivering the orders with these BMW bikes?” someone asked with his voice trembling.</p>  <p id = > “Of course,” Philip said. “From now on, we’re going to be the most ostentatious one in our industry. We have to increase our productivity. I have huge goals and I want to be the number one delivery company in Riverdale. Then, I’m going to expand the business all over the country. Agnes, are you confident?”</p>  <p id = > Agnes was shocked. She got up and nodded before saying solemnly, “Don’t worry, Mr. Clarke. I’ll do my best.”</p>  <p id = > Everyone raised their glasses and promised to work hard and strive for the better.</p>  <p id = > “Sir, your dishes…”</p>  <p id = > The waitress walked into the private room. She wanted to ask Philip about the dishes, but her eyes landed on the keys on the table. She was so shocked that she did not know how to speak anymore.</p>  <p id = > “You can bring them in now. Right, I said I wanted Lafite from 1982, right? Give me two boxes of them. Also, give me the best Maotai you have. Give three of them to each table.”</p>  <p id = > “Alright, Sir.”</p>  <p id = > When she left the room, the waitress’s eyes were still on the table.</p>  <p id = > She could not help it. She was so shocked by what she saw.</p>  <p id = > All of the dishes were here. There was shark fin’s soup, bird’s nest, foie gras, Périgord black truffle, shirako from a blowfish, and so on. The colleagues from the company were once again shocked. This was too extravagant. Even Agnes had not eaten a meal as extravagant as this before.</p>  <p id = > “We’ll drink to our hearts’ content tonight. The first glass is to fate. It’s only because of fate that everyone can gather here tonight.”</p>  <p id = > As he said that, Philip lifted his glass and downed the contents.</p>  <p id = > Philip’s alcohol tolerance was not that good, but it was not bad either. It was just so-so.</p>  <p id = > The main point was that his identity right now was too respectable. Everyone had to look up to him.</p>  <p id = > However, despite this, Philip was not snobbish nor arrogant.</p>  <p id = > Everyone lifted their glasses to drink with him.</p>  <p id = > When he saw this, Philip knew he could not escape. He took two tiny sips.</p>  <p id = > When it was time to pay, the waitress walked over with a million-dollar bill.</p>  <p id = > Philip did not even look at it. He swiped his card directly.</p>  <p id = > After dinner, Philip let Agnes make some arrangements and asked the substitute drivers to drive the cars back to the office. The drivers each got 200 bucks as tips.</p>  <p id = > As he got up, Philip said with a smile on his face, “Let’s have an after-party! Let’s continue this at Smith’s Bar!”</p>  <p id = > “Philip, you’re so generous!”</p>  <p id = > “Mr. Clarke is so honorable!”</p>  <p id = > “I’ve been wanting to go to Smith’s Bar for a long time, but I never had the money. I heard the chicks there are amazing.”</p>  <p id = > When the waitresses heard that, they all looked envious. ‘Where can I find bosses like him? Give me a dozen of them!’</p>  <p id = > “Mr. Clarke, do you want to go back to take a look at Mila?” Agnes said in a worried voice when she saw Philip shaking as he got up.</p>  <p id = > “I’m fine. I’m going to let you guys take a two-day leave after this. Paid leaves.” Philip waved his hand.</p>  <p id = > What an affluent nouveau riche!</p>  <p id = > Paid leaves!</p>  <p id = > Did the wind bring him his money?</p>  <p id = > After the battle ended here, Philip and the gang went to another location.</p>  <p id = > However, when he just got out of the door, he heard a curious and mocking voice calling his name.</p>  <p id = > “Philip?”</p>          <h2 id =chapter-72 > Chapter 72</h2> <p id = > Philip Clarke lifted his gaze and was met with a familiar face. That person was wearing an expression of mocking sarcasm.</p>  <p id = > “Weslie Warren?”</p>  <p id = > Philip frowned. They had been classmates during their university days. In fact, they both fell for Wynn Johnston, making them more of rivals to be exact.</p>  <p id = > However, Wynn had chosen to be with the talented Philip Clarke in the end.</p>  <p id = > In regards to that, Wesley still held grudges.</p>  <p id = > He was not any less of a man than Philip was as far as he was concerned. Yet, why did Wynn choose Philip over him?</p>  <p id = > Not to mention, Philip did not have much going for him from what Wesley had heard. Philip’s plan to start his own business failed and he now resorted to earning his keep through delivering food. His daughter was diagnosed with Congenital Heart Defect, and his marriage with Wynn was no longer the way it used to be.</p>  <p id = > The worse the turn Philip Clarke’s life had taken, the more hatred Wesley felt in his heart.</p>  <p id = > It was only normal for men to hold grudges when the love of their university life was taken away.</p>  <p id = > ‘Absolute piece of trash! How dare he make the woman I love suffer!’</p>  <p id = > “Holy sh*t! It f*cking is you, my old classmate!”</p>  <p id = > Wesley laughed heartily as he walked over. Patting Philip on the shoulder, he said, “It has been four years since we last met! I hear you’ve changed jobs and started delivering food now? So, how much do you earn a month? Not too bad a salary, I presume.”</p>  <p id = > Wesley’s tone oozed with arrogant mocking.</p>  <p id = > Philip furrowed his eyebrows and smiled. “It’s not too bad.”</p>  <p id = > Wesley chuckled. Knowing that Philip was trying his best not to look weak, he fetched out a shiny golden card and gave it to Philip as one would give beggars change. Proudly, he proclaimed, “If you ever want to come and eat, simply call my number. I’ll give you a discount, seeing how we’re old classmates and all.”</p>  <p id = > Philip glanced calmly at the name on the golden business card before him. Wesley Warren, Manager of Arc de Triumph.</p>  <p id = > Indeed, one would find it hard to compare to Wesley’s family background.</p>  <p id = > It had only been three or four years since graduation, and he had already found himself in the position of Arc de Triumph’s manager.</p>  <p id = > Arc de Triumph Hotel was one of Riverdale’s famous hotels.</p>  <p id = > With chains all over the country, Arc de Triumph was a five-star hotel!</p>  <p id = > Being its manager evidently implied Wesley’s ability in the way he did things.</p>  <p id = > The corner of Philip’s lips twitched into a slight smile. “Thanks.”</p>  <p id = > Pride swarmed Wesley’s eyes as he smiled. “What’s there to thank me for? It’s not like you’ll come here all the time. I’d say once a year at most, no? We’re old classmates, it’s only right if I get you a discount. Not to mention, I hardly believe you’ll be able to afford the food here anyway with your wage as a delivery boy. I’ve heard that you need money for your daughter’s sickness, and by aiding you, I’d like to think I’m also helping Wynn.”</p>  <p id = > Wesley made sure to put extra emphasis on his daughter’s sickness and Wynn Johnston when he spoke.</p>  <p id = > Suddenly, a thought came to Wesley. “Hey, I heard people say you’re getting a divorce with Wynn? Is it true? Everyone envied your relationship back then. It has only been three years though, why the divorce?</p>  <p id = > “Oh, right! It was a shotgun wedding, wasn’t it? Good job, man. You got on the train before you even paid for the ticket.”</p>  <p id = > Wesley said with a smile, his words dripping with a thick coat of sarcasm.</p>  <p id = > Philip replied calmly, “I don’t think there’s much of my divorce with Wynn that’s of your concern.”</p>  <p id = > Wesley did not take the hint, sighing. “Philip, I don’t want to say this, my dude. But what good is there from delivering food? You were our idol back in university with your high spirits and all. I admired you then, but what happened to you? How did you get like this?”</p>  <p id = > Philip squinted.</p>  <p id = > Wesley was a cheap man. Sure, it might seem that they were reminiscing about the past, yet every word he spoke was one of criticism and mocking jabs.</p>  <p id = > Coupled with his arrogant and provocative expression, he held not even an ounce of respect for Philip.</p>  <p id = > “But that’s alright. I believe in you. Even though you’re merely delivering food right now, hard work is hard work, right? I’m sure you’ll get to deliver parcels soon. By the time your divorce with Wynn goes through, I’ll definitely chase her again. I still miss her even after all these years.”</p>  <p id = > Wesley shrugged. “Oh yeah. There’s a reunion party next month. You’ve got to come, dude, and remember to bring Wynn too since you haven’t joined the last two years. Unless you’re afraid that the rest of us old classmates will make fun of you?”</p>  <p id = > Philip smiled. “What are you trying to say?”</p>  <p id = > “Nothing much. It's just that you know how humans are. When we see something pitiful, we can’t help but sympathize. Seeing your failure, I’ve found myself more at peace.” Wesley roared in laughter.</p>  <p id = > What else could he be saying?</p>  <p id = > He was laughing at Philip!</p>  <p id = > Every depressing and resigned thought in his mind disappeared instantly. Looking at Philip’s current state made Wesley’s heart fill with glee.</p>  <p id = > He stared at Philip, trying to find even a shred of embarrassment or shame in his expression.</p>  <p id = > However, all that met him was Philip’s same expression of calm.</p>  <p id = > Fine, keep pretending!</p>  <p id = > Philip shrugged. “Do you think you’re f*cking cool, Wesley Warren? The road of life is a long one. What makes you think I won’t end up at a higher spot than you in the future?”</p>  <p id = > With that, Philip slid the gold card back into the pocket of Wesley’s blazer and turned to leave.</p>  <p id = > Wesley did not like that.</p>  <p id = > Despite how bad a turn his life had taken, Philip was still being arrogant.</p>  <p id = > Back then in university, he was indeed no match for Philip Clarke.</p>  <p id = > As long as Philip was present, Wesley easily became the side character.</p>  <p id = > Now with Philip’s life taking a turn for the worse coupled with the large gap between both their statuses, Wesley felt an unparalleled sense of calm.</p>  <p id = > He wanted to mock Philip with all he had.</p>  <p id = > He wanted to take back everything he lost back then.</p>  <p id = > Including Wynn Johnston.</p>   <h2 id =chapter-73 > Chapter 73</h2> <p id = > “Wait, Philip, hold on. Why the rush? It’s not always that we get to meet old classmates. Let’s talk for a little longer.” Wesley ran after him.</p>  <p id = > Philip’s eyebrows furrowed further, his expression darkening.</p>  <p id = > There was little he and Wesley Warren had in common. Philip would very much rather not deal with old classmates like him anymore.</p>  <p id = > They had changed—changed into people of greater statuses.</p>  <p id = > Philip shook his head and said coldly, “Back then, you were but a piece of trash to me, Wesley Warren. Though I did not expect that you’d still be a piece of trash now.”</p>  <p id = > Wesley froze. “What did you say?”</p>  <p id = > He did not expect a sentence like that to come out from the mouth of a good-for-nothing like Philip Clarke.</p>  <p id = > He called him a piece of trash?</p>  <p id = > Who was the real piece of trash here?</p>  <p id = > “You think that now you’re the manager of Arc de Triumph, you’re at the top of the world? So cool now, are you? So you’re showing it off to rub it in my face? What’s wrong with us delivery boys? You think you’re f*cking better than us?” Philip snorted.</p>  <p id = > He had kept it in for long enough.</p>  <p id = > Not wanting to add fuel to the flames, he did not expect his toleration to result in the other’s aggravation.</p>  <p id = > “Haha! Philip Clarke you dumb f*cker, are you kidding me?” Wesley laughed, his expression potent with means to mock. “I, the manager of Arc de Triumph, earn a monthly salary of 40 thousand! You’re just a delivery boy. Even after working your *ss off, I doubt if you can even earn six thousand. Perhaps you only earn slightly more than five thousand a month. What do you have that’s better than me in terms of familial background, status, and contacts? How am I not better than you, Philip Clarke? Yeah, I’m f*cking better than you, Philip! What are you gonna do about it, huh?”</p>  <p id = > Wesley could not tolerate how the other was still pretending to be all high and mighty.</p>  <p id = > “You were f*cking great during university. You even had yourself a bunch of juniors falling at your feet. Why’re you delivering food now? I’ll tell you why. ‘Cause you suck! You are all pieces of trash in my eyes! So what if I think I’m better than you all?” Wesley seemed proud of himself.</p>  <p id = > Not only had Wesley offended Philip with what he said, but he also offended all of Philip’s colleagues who were present at the scene.</p>  <p id = > Now over 60 people were angry at Wesley!</p>  <p id = > Stomping over to him, they surrounded Wesley with a menacing look on their faces.</p>  <p id = > “Sure, all of us deliver food. So what if you’re a manager? You’re working for other people too!”</p>  <p id = > “What’s this now? I heard someone calling us delivery boys pieces of trash. What are you, some kind of god? Think you’re on the top of the world?”</p>  <p id = > “F*ck this! I hate people like you, I’m gonna f*ck you up! Absolutely disgusting!”</p>  <p id = > Instantly, the lobby began to riot.</p>  <p id = > Many had resorted to violence. They were letting their fists do the talking.</p>  <p id = > Right then, tens of bodyguards rushed to the scene. With Wesley protected behind them, the bodyguards stood off against Philip’s mob of people.</p>  <p id = > “F*ck! They have the f*cking galls to hit me! What are you doing? Get this group of busybodies out!” Wesley roared as he straightened his suit and touched the spot on his face where he had been punched.</p>  <p id = > The group of bodyguards had Philip’s mob of people surrounded in an instant. Merely surrounded and nothing more.</p>  <p id = > There were too many people, after all. Over 60 of them.</p>  <p id = > All of them stood on Philip’s side as they glared at Wesley.</p>  <p id = > “Very well, Philip Clarke. Can’t get you to leave on your own, huh? Fine. If you don’t want to leave on your own, then don’t blame me for not being polite!” Wesley glared ominously at Philip.</p>  <p id = > With that, Wesley pulled out his cell and called security. “I’ve got work for you. Get here!”</p>  <p id = > Elated was an understatement to how he felt at the moment for he could pretty much already see the scene of Philip Clarke being shamefully thrown out of the hotel.</p>  <p id = > Trying to look cool in front of me with a gang of delivery boys? F*ck you!</p>  <p id = > At the same time, the head of security arrived only to see the scene of chaos before him. Shocked, he quickly ran over.</p>  <p id = > “Manager Warren. What happened?”</p>  <p id = > “You’re just in time. Throw this gang of f*cking *ssholes out!”</p>  <p id = > “I can’t do that Manager Warren. These are our hotel’s VIP clients!”</p>  <p id = > The head of security was stunned. Although he had no idea what was going on, it was evident to him that Wesley was picking on Philip’s group of people.</p>  <p id = > “What do you mean you can’t? They’re merely a bunch of delivery boys, how can they be our hotel’s VIP clients?” Wesley sneered, a mocking expression painting his face. He then slapped the head of security, pointed his finger at him, and began to reprimand. “Who’s the manager here? If I tell you to throw them out, you throw them out!”</p>  <p id = > ‘What a waste of space. Talking back to a superior too!’</p>  <p id = > “Manager Warren, they’re really our hotel’s VIP clients. There’re at least 100 BMW motorcycles outside, all parked under this client’s name. I can’t be responsible for the consequences if I were to throw them out.”</p>  <p id = > The head of security did not like it one bit, but he kept it in.</p>  <p id = > Wesley was always arrogant and domineering, so the staff would usually just turn a blind eye.</p>  <p id = > Yet now he wanted to throw these people, who were evidently VIPs, out?</p>  <p id = > He would surely be fired if their boss got wind of this.</p>  <p id = > Wesley burst into laughter after hearing what the head of security said. “What kind of joke is this? 100 BMW motorcycles? Who the f*ck are you kidding?”</p>  <p id = > Wesley laughed harder.</p>  <p id = > He, too, had seen the 100 BMW motorcycles parked outside and was envious.</p>  <p id = > After realizing that such a nouveau riche VIP client had come to the hotel, Wesley initially planned to make connections. When he saw Philip Clarke instead, he decided to mock him a little.</p>  <p id = > Now, someone was telling him that the 100 BMW bikes outside were being used for food deliveries and that they belonged to Philip.</p>  <p id = > This must be a f*cking joke!</p>  <p id = > Yet, right at that moment...</p>  <p id = > Philip took his phone from his pocket and dialed for George Thomas. “Hey, Old Man George. How much to buy Arc de Triumph?”</p>   <h2 id =chapter-74 > Chapter 74</h2> <p id = > “Young Master, it’ll cost you 18 billion to buy Arc de Triumph as there are 50 branches throughout the entire country.”</p>  <p id = > On the other side of the line stood George before the floor-to-ceiling window. He was reading off the data report in his hand.</p>  <p id = > His secretary had gotten him a full list of Arc de Triumph’s assets and financial statements pretty much the moment Philip asked.</p>  <p id = > “I don’t care how many billions it costs, I want it bought.” Philip Clarke sounded evidently annoyed.</p>  <p id = > “Very well, Young Master,” George replied and made another call.</p>  <p id = > Instantly, numerous direct calls were made from Riverdale to Arc de Triumph’s headquarters in Capital City.</p>  <p id = > That night, a mysterious force began to operate secretly in Riverdale and Capital City.</p>  <p id = > By the side, Wesley stared coldly at Philip and mocked. “Oh? It has been so long since we met. I see your ability to lie through your teeth has gotten better. Purchasing Arc de Triumph? What a bold statement to make.”</p>  <p id = > ‘Who does he think he is, buying Arc de Triumph like it’s no big deal!</p>  <p id = > ‘Is he even aware of Arc de Triumph’s market price?</p>  <p id = > ‘20 billion!</p>  <p id = > ‘Putting up a cool front now, are you? Hah. As if you’re the only one who knows how.</p>  <p id = > ‘Still, if you’re gonna lie, at least make it f*cking plausible.</p>  <p id = > ‘What do you take us for? Idiots? Just buying off the entire Arc De Triumph like that.’</p>  <p id = > Not too long later, another call from George arrived. “All preparations have been made, Young Master. You are now the legal owner of Arc de Triumph. After spending a total of 20 billion, all three main shareholders have sold their shares. You now have 100 percent of all the shares, and therefore absolute authority.”</p>  <p id = > “Very well. Good job,” Philip Clarke replied calmly.</p>  <p id = > If anything, George Thomas was an efficient man.</p>  <p id = > “Oh, and have their head come here now,” Philip Clarke said.</p>  <p id = > Watching Philip converse with someone cryptically over the phone, Wesley sneered. “Oh? Quite the show you’ve put on here. So who did you call? You want to buy Arc de Triumph, don’t you? Go on, do it in front of me right now. The moment you purchase Arc de Triumph, I’ll bow and prostrate to you, Philip Clarke.”</p>  <p id = > ‘Just this Arc de Triumph branch in Riverdale itself costs around 200 million.</p>  <p id = > ‘Let alone the headquarters of the group itself costing 20 billion!</p>  <p id = > ‘And now you’re purchasing the entirety of Arc de Triumph?’</p>  <p id = > At the same time, George had made a direct phone call with the head of Riverdale’s branch.</p>  <p id = > “Hey, Mr. Thomas! This is the first time you’ve called me. How can I help you?” From the other end of the line sounded a polite and mellow tone of a middle-aged man.</p>  <p id = > “Mr. Yeager, our young master is currently at your hotel. He has requested your presence and hopes to see you in five minutes.”</p>  <p id = > Hearing him, Zayn Yeager jolted awake.</p>  <p id = > Mr. Thomas’ young master. That was a man of great f*cking status.</p>  <p id = > “Of course, Mr. Thomas. I’ll be there shortly.”</p>  <p id = > Promising so, Zayn Yeager hung up and made a dash for Arc de Triumph.</p>  <p id = > Back to Wesley who was still staring condescendingly at Philip Clarke. “You're still keeping up that facade, Philip? Fine! I’ll play your little game. Let’s see how f*cking cool you actually are!”</p>  <p id = > Both his hands were in his pant pockets while his expression was one of jeering sarcasm.</p>  <p id = > Philip did not seem impatient. While calmly sitting on a seat by the side, he pulled out his phone to video call Mila.</p>  <p id = > She was currently being taken care of by the company’s babysitter.</p>  <p id = > He would pick her up later that day.</p>  <p id = > Due to Philip’s working conditions and the fact that his parents-in-law had never bothered to take care of her, Mila spent most of her time away in a nursery.</p>  <p id = > Around five minutes later, Zayn Yeager, the head of the Arc de Triumph Riverdale branch, appeared at the lobby’s entrance.</p>  <p id = > Setting his eyes on the scene in the lobby before him, he felt a slight unease.</p>  <p id = > He arrived quickly before Wesley and asked, “Manager Wesley, what seems to be the matter?”</p>  <p id = > Wesley was stunned. He did not expect the head of the branch to arrive as per Philip’s request.</p>  <p id = > As Zayn was the person in charge of the group’s Riverdale branch, Wesley had no choice but to be humble and smile. “It’s nothing I can’t handle, Mr. Yeager.”</p>  <p id = > Zayn Yeager frowned instantly. “Nothing you can’t handle? The security team is here and yet you call this nothing? Forget it, I’ll deal with this myself.”</p>  <p id = > Should Mr. Thomas’ young master be offended, it would be the end of his, Zayn Yeager’s, career in Riverdale.</p>  <p id = > Following that train of thought, the hair on the back of his neck stood in fear.</p>  <p id = > As for Mr. Thomas’ young master... Well, what better person to suck up to?</p>  <p id = > Quickly taking a step forward to screen the group of people before him, he asked courteously, “Excuse me, which one of you is Master Clarke? Mr. Philip Clarke?”</p>  <p id = > Everyone was stunned. Collectively, all gazes fell on Philip.</p>     <h2 id =chapter-75 > Chapter 75</h2> <p id = > ‘Master Clarke?’</p>  <p id = > Wesley was stunned. What a joke!</p>  <p id = > ‘Master Clarke? This f*cking asshole?’</p>  <p id = > Then, Philip stood forward. “That would be me. I’m Philip Clarke.”</p>  <p id = > With that, he pointed a finger at Wesley and demanded, “From today onwards, this man is to be removed from Arc de Triumph. I don’t want to see him in any branch at all. Can that be done?”</p>  <p id = > Zayn Yeager tensed. Glancing at Wesley from the corner of his eyes, he said, “I’m afraid not, Master Clarke.”</p>  <p id = > He knew Wesley must have had a conflict with Philip Clarke.</p>  <p id = > Yet to fire Wesley with just a word, that was something Zayn Yeager could not do.</p>  <p id = > Even after disregarding the fact that doing so was against the rules of the hotel, Wesley Warren’s father was one of the hotel’s shareholders. That was a person worth a few hundred million!</p>  <p id = > That itself was enough reason to stop him from firing Wesley.</p>  <p id = > However, Philip’s next sentence shook everyone to their bones. “You might not know, but I’ve already purchased the entirety of Arc de Triumph. I am now the biggest shareholder of Arc de Triumph, holding 100 percent of all the stocks.”</p>  <p id = > Hearing him, Wesley doubled over in laughter.</p>  <p id = > “You bought the entire Arc de Triumph? And you hold 100 percent of the stocks? Please, who are you kidding? I don’t think you know, but my father is one of Arc de Triumph’s shareholders, okay!”</p>  <p id = > Zayn Yeager frowned as well. “Master Clarke, while I am aware of your relationship with Mr. Thomas, I would not advise that you make such jokes in the future. As far as I am concerned, there has yet to be any changes in Arc de Triumph’s shareholders.”</p>  <p id = > His expression darkened. Had it not been on behalf of the fact that this was Mr. Thomas’ Master Clarke, he would have thrown this arrogant little sh*t out already.</p>  <p id = > However, the expression Philip wore was too genuine and calm.</p>  <p id = > It did not seem like he was joking.</p>  <p id = > That was something Zayn Yeager could not seem to understand. There was no Mr. Clarke among the list of Arc de Triumph’s shareholders.</p>  <p id = > “Oh, yeah. I just bought it, so I suppose the share transfer form will arrive in a bit.” Philip Clarke clarified calmly.</p>  <p id = > “Holy f*ck, Philip Clarke! If you’re going to lie, at least make it reasonable! My dad owns two percent of Arc de Triumph’s stocks. It may not seem much, but that’s still 300 to 400 million! Do you get it now, you poor f*ck!” Wesley sneered.</p>  <p id = > Ding dong!</p>  <p id = > Right at that moment, Philip’s cell phone pinged to signify the arrival of mail.</p>  <p id = > Clicking on the notification, he showed Zayn Yeager the mail.</p>  <p id = > Zayn was dazed when he read the contents of the mail.</p>  <p id = > Right before him was Arc de Triumph Group’s document of proof for the highest authority shareholder.</p>  <p id = > Written on the document was the name of the newly appointed largest shareholder. With only one name present, Philip Clarke owned 100% of all Arc de Triumph Group’s shares.</p>  <p id = > Moreover, the document was stamped with Arc de Triumph Group’s seal!</p>  <p id = > There was no mistaking its legitimacy. After all, forgery of legal documents was a felony and a risk not worth taking for the sake of play-pretend.</p>  <p id = > “Forgive me, Master Clarke. But I still have to clarify.”</p>  <p id = > Zayn was a shrewd man. Taking out his phone, he walked off to the side.</p>  <p id = > It was simple. All he had to do was ask the shareholders of the company, and Wesley’s father was the most convenient option of all.</p>  <p id = > After all, Wesley’s father owned two percent of the shares.</p>  <p id = > If the transfer of shares was true, Master Clarke would then be the one man he could never offend. In fact, he would have to treat him like one would a Buddha!</p>  <p id = > “Mr. Warren, something has occurred over here that I would like to verify with you if that’s okay? Well, uh, we have a Mr. Clarke here who claims that he has purchased all of Arc de Triumph’s shares. And there might have been some sort of conflict between him and your son…”</p>  <p id = > From the other end of the line drifted in a panting baritone accompanied by the soft cries of a charming lady.</p>  <p id = > “What the hell? What Mr. Clarke? Bullsh*t! The entirety of Arc de Triumph amounts up to 20 billion. Who in the world has the money to buy it all in one go?! Throw the f*cker out and leave me alone!”</p>  <p id = > Slam! The call ended.</p>  <p id = > Zayn’s expression shifted at the unexpected turn of events.</p>  <p id = > Back where Wesley stood, he continued to glare at Philip. With a frosty gaze, he scoffed. “Hah. I’ve got to give it to you though, you just had to lie and be cool didn’t you? Don’t you know my father’s also Arc de Triumph’s shareholder?”</p>  <p id = > Philip shook his head and simply claimed, “Nope. Though I suppose as a small shareholder, the transfer of shares shouldn’t have much to do with him either.”</p>  <p id = > “Haha, bullsh*t! My father’s shares in Arc de Triumph are worth around 300 to 400 million! 300 to 400 million! Do you have any idea how much that is?! You might not even earn that much your entire life. Perhaps the farthest you’ll go is by lying like this. So sad.” Wesley shook his head, his expression that of mocking pity.</p>  <p id = > Brushing off the comment, Philip Clarke stated, “That’s fine. Both you and your father will be thrown out of Arc de Triumph in a moment anyway. So if anything, you should feel sad for yourself.”</p>    <h2 id =chapter-76 > Chapter 76</h2> <p id = > Wesley Warren flushed a deep red!</p>  <p id = > He had been humiliated!</p>  <p id = > ‘How dare this piece of trash say such things?</p>  <p id = > ‘How dare he threaten to throw me and dad out of Arc de Triumph?!</p>  <p id = > ‘Where did this idiot get his bravery from?</p>  <p id = > ‘Fish Leong?</p>  <p id = > ‘This was preposterous!’</p>  <p id = > “So Philip Clarke, does this mean that as long as I’m not thrown out of Arc de Triumph by the end of today, I’ll hear a ‘Master Wesley’ from your mouth as you kneel before me?” Wesley was pissed. The corners of his lips lifted into a sneer as he spoke.</p>  <p id = > Perhaps, all that Philip had left was his ability to bluff.</p>  <p id = > “Slim chance. Hardly probable.”</p>  <p id = > Philip did not want to entertain Wesley either, considering his goal here was to have dinner. He never planned to stir trouble, but the other had done nothing but humiliate him the entire time. To turn a blind eye would be a disgrace to his identity as the heir to his family’s fortune!</p>  <p id = > ‘So Wesley Warren wants to be arrogant?</p>  <p id = > ‘So he thinks he holds the higher ground?</p>  <p id = > ‘Very well. Then I shall take away your status and everything you own!’</p>  <p id = > Right then, Zayn returned after the call with a sour expression. “Master Clarke, I’m afraid that there has yet to be any confirming replies on my behalf. So…”</p>  <p id = > The implications were clear—‘I have yet to receive any news, so I am unable to affirm your document for the transfer of shares.’</p>  <p id = > Wesley burst into laughter, his expression sarcastic and unkind. “You hear that? Still f*cking posing are you? You have my respect. Why Wynn would choose a good-for-nothing like you is out of my comprehensive abilities!”</p>  <p id = > ‘Hilarious, f*cking hilarious!</p>  <p id = > ‘His lie has been seen through, and here he is still calm and unnerved.’</p>  <p id = > Philip did not say much. He merely opted to reply nonchalantly, “Give it a moment. I believe the man you called is his dad, Samuel Warren? I do suppose he wouldn’t have much of a say at the shareholder meeting with his two percent stocks. So it makes sense that his father doesn’t know of it yet. It should be any moment now, though.”</p>  <p id = > Philip was right.</p>  <p id = > This transfer of shares was an unanimous agreement made by all major shareholders.</p>  <p id = > Minor shareholders had no say at all.</p>  <p id = > As a result, Samuel Warren had yet to receive a notice.</p>  <p id = > Though it would not be too long before he would.</p>  <p id = > With that said, there was nothing more Philip could do, and so he began to chat with his colleagues.</p>  <p id = > “Quite the poser you are, Philip Clarke. My dad has no right, you say? You’re hilarious. Who do you think you are? The amazing Jack Ma? Or do you think you’re Warren Buffett? You’re nothing but dog sh*t! Purchasing Arc de Triumph? Do you even have 20 billion? F*cking idiot!” Wesley chuckled coldly at Philip.</p>  <p id = > Philip merely shrugged in response. “What difference are you to that of a frog at the bottom of the well? There is more to the world than either of us know, and I would greatly appreciate it if you would be so kind to stop judging me with the limited knowledge you have. You cannot possibly have an idea about how much money I have, for not even I myself know the exact amount. However, it is likely that the people you’ve mentioned, Jack Ma and Warren Buffet, do not have as much as I do.”</p>  <p id = > F*ck!</p>  <p id = > Every word that came out from his mouth was pure bullsh*t!</p>  <p id = > Did he think he was Takumi Fujiwara from Initial D?</p>  <p id = > What ostentatious bullsh*t!</p>  <p id = > Though, Philip Clarke was not wrong.</p>  <p id = > Even with the total net worth of all the nouveau riche on Forbes, it might still not amount to half the money his family had.</p>  <p id = > Over 70% of the world’s riches belonged to his family.</p>  <p id = > Who could possibly be richer than him?</p>  <p id = > It was just that Philip personally did not wish to take over his family business.</p>  <p id = > “Fine, fine. I’ll just watch how the f*ck you plan to lie your way out of this!” Wesley was infuriated.</p>  <p id = > ‘How dare you, Philip Clarke.</p>  <p id = > ‘As competitors back in university, I lost. Wynn Johnston married you.</p>  <p id = > ‘Now that I’m the manager of Arc de Triumph, there’s no way I can’t tower over you with my status and social standing!</p>  <p id = > ‘You’re not the only one who knows how to look pretentious!’</p>  <p id = > Wesley was enraged at that moment, the raging fire in his heart burning mercilessly.</p>  <p id = > Alas, he knew nothing of Philip’s past, nor of the power he held.</p>  <p id = > At the same time, in one of Riverdale’s five-star hotels.</p>  <p id = > Samuel Warren laid comfortably on the goose-feather bed. Held lovingly in his arms was his newest female secretary.</p>  <p id = > Samuel’s phone rang. The caller ID showed that it was from Arc de Triumph’s general finance manager!</p>  <p id = > No longer paying the woman in his arms any attention, Samuel picked up the call. “Hello, Mr. Zach? Has something occurred? An issue so major that you’re calling so late at night?”</p>  <p id = > “Mr. Warren. I’m here with a notice. Arc de Triumph has changed its major shareholder. All shares have been transferred to a Mr. Clark, Mr. Philip Clarke. We’ve cashed your percentage into your bank accounts, amounting to 300 million. We wish for your kind understanding.”</p>    <h2 id =chapter-77 > Chapter 77</h2> <p id = > Hearing that, Samuel froze in shock!</p>  <p id = > ‘There has been a transfer of Arc de Triumph’s shares!</p>  <p id = > ‘Amounting to 20 billion!</p>  <p id = > ‘So Zayn Yeager was speaking the truth when he called just now?</p>  <p id = > ‘All 100 percent of the shares?</p>  <p id = > ‘No way!</p>  <p id = > ‘We’re talking about a whole 20 billion!</p>  <p id = > ‘Who the f*ck swallowed the entire Arc de Triumph in one gulp?</p>  <p id = > ‘Not even those on the Orienta’s list of millionaires can buy it all in one night!’</p>  <p id = > Fear crept up on Samuel. He immediately recalled how Zayn mentioned something along the lines of Wesley having a conflict with Mr. Clarke!</p>  <p id = > ‘Crap! I should call and ask.’</p>  <p id = > Shortly, Zayn received a call from Samuel. “Mr. Warren? Is something of the matter?”</p>  <p id = > “Pass the phone to Mr. Clarke.” Samuel was restless.</p>  <p id = > Despite not understanding the other’s intentions, Zayn passed the phone to Philip anyway. “Master Clarke, Mr. Warren wishes to speak to you.”</p>  <p id = > Philip took the phone and from the other end came the baritone voice of a middle-aged man.</p>  <p id = > “Mr. Clarke? This is Samuel Warren.”</p>  <p id = > “Oh? Hello, Mr. Warren.”</p>  <p id = > “Mr. Clarke, I apologize if my son has offended you in any way. He was in the wrong, and if you so require, I shall apologize to you personally.”</p>  <p id = > Anxiety brewed within Samuel, stemmed from the fear that his son might have unknowingly offended this new and only major shareholder of Arc de Triumph that had appeared out of the blue!</p>  <p id = > ‘For a man of this caliber, one can only imagine the tricks he has up his sleeves and the assets and money he possesses!</p>  <p id = > ‘He’s definitely not one to be messed with!’</p>  <p id = > “Mr. Warren, to tell you the truth, I wouldn’t consider myself a man who likes holding grudges. How about we do it this way, then? You sell me every company you have under your name, and we call it even?”</p>  <p id = > “Huh?”</p>  <p id = > Samuel was shocked.</p>  <p id = > He could not understand a thing of what the other person was trying to say.</p>  <p id = > Sure, there were a few companies he owned, but even all of them together were worth 100 million or so only.</p>  <p id = > Moreover, those companies were flourishing right now. Having received a Series A angel round of 20 million, they were planning to invest in the US market and receive a Series B investment of 100 million!</p>  <p id = > As much as these were opportunities to Samuel Warren, they had also become his life force.</p>  <p id = > After all, these companies could be his path to the Forbes list!</p>  <p id = > There was no way he would sell them.</p>  <p id = > “That’s a funny joke, Mr. Clarke. Those companies of mine are merely little assets. I’m sure they’re too insignificant for you to consider.” Samuel chuckled dryly.</p>  <p id = > “Very well, then. Though from what I remember, those companies of yours are close to declaring bankruptcy, aren’t they? If my memory serves me right, you’ve just received a Series A angel round right? And now you’re planning for a Series B worth 100 million? What a shame it would be should they end up bankrupt.”</p>  <p id = > Philip said calmly with a smile. In his other hand was his own phone detailed with everything George had sent over concerning Samuel Warren.</p>  <p id = > From the moment he was born to his work experiences to the companies under his name and how they were fending, everything was there, written clearly in black and white.</p>  <p id = > Samuel shivered and his eyebrow twitched. “Mr. Clarke, they say you never know someone ‘till you’ve fought them, but I don’t think there’s a need for that now is there? You’re at Arc de Triumph, aren’t you? I’ll be there shortly.”</p>  <p id = > ‘End up bankrupt?</p>  <p id = > ‘What a bold claim this Mr. Clarke has made.</p>  <p id = > ‘To know of my angel round and the investment in markets overseas?</p>  <p id = > ‘And yet...’</p>  <p id = > Philip huffed a breath of laughter. “I don’t have all the time in the world, Mr. Warren. How about we do it this way? You have half an hour to consider my proposal. If you’ve thought it through well, then you’ll sell me your company. If not, then I suppose you can just wait to declare bankruptcy.”</p>  <p id = > Philip was nothing if not calm.</p>  <p id = > That only lead to Samuel becoming more agitated and restless.</p>  <p id = > “Is this some sort of bad joke, Mr. Clarke?” Samuel chuckled suddenly.</p>  <p id = > He refused to believe that one man would have the power to influence his angel round investment and financing corporations overseas.</p>  <p id = > “I’ve never been one to tell jokes. You have half an hour to think about whether you’ll sell or if you’ll declare bankruptcy. Your choice.”</p>  <p id = > Philip said in a steady tone and hung up the phone.</p>  <p id = > He was not interested in unnecessary chit-chatting with Samuel Warren.</p>  <p id = > His choices had been presented before him.</p>  <p id = > Philip’s only goal was simple. All he wanted was for Wesley to understand that not everyone was for him to play with for his entertainment!</p>  <p id = > Philip was aware that he might have taken it a little too far today.</p>  <p id = > With that being said, he was fine with it. After all, it was not a pleasant feeling to be constantly picked and looked down on.</p>  <p id = > After being hanged up on, Samuel laid in his hotel suite with anxiety tugging at his heart.</p>  <p id = > ‘Will we go bankrupt?</p>  <p id = > ‘Who exactly is this young man who has just bought the entirety of Arc de Triumph’s stocks?</p>  <p id = > ‘I don’t get it.’</p>  <p id = > However, Samuel had been working in the market for so long. He would like to believe he had at least learned something from his years of experience.</p>  <p id = > ‘Trying to force me into selling my company? You wish!</p>  <p id = > ‘I’d like to know just who the f*ck you think you are!’</p>  <p id = > No longer in the mood for anything, Samuel kicked the lady atop him away.</p>  <p id = > Taking his phone again, he dialed an infrequently contacted number as a courteous smile dawned on his features. “How’re you doing, Chief Sullivan? We both know I wouldn’t come to you if I didn’t have anything to ask, so I’ll get straight to the point. Something’s occurred and I require your help, Chief Sullivan.”</p>          <h2 id =chapter-78 > Chapter 78</h2> <p id = > “Samuel Warren! Don’t just call me when you feel like it and make me clean up after you! This is a difficult time right now. You could put me in danger for this!”</p>  <p id = > From the other end of the line was the voice of a pissed and irked man.</p>  <p id = > Samuel was far from angry and replied in a flattering tone, “Johann, my brother! Something came up, you see. I can only turn to you, Brother.”</p>  <p id = > Johann Sullivan was Samuel’s source of power in Riverdale.</p>  <p id = > It was thanks to Johann that he was where he was today.</p>  <p id = > As a result, he had paid a considerable amount of respect in return.</p>  <p id = > It was just that Johann had specified not to contact him unless something great occurred.</p>  <p id = > Johann begrudgingly left his bed and wore his presbyopic glasses. “What happened?”</p>  <p id = > Samuel was not a horrible person. He knew the rules, so something big must have happened for him to call him this late at night.</p>  <p id = > “Something’s happened to the company, Johann. There’s a young man by the name of Philip Clarke who wants to buy our company. He says he’ll make us go bankrupt if we refuse to sell,” Samuel said worriedly.</p>  <p id = > “Samuel Warren! Is this what you’re calling me so late for? What the f*ck? Did you drink yourself into oblivion or are you sleeping with too many women? It’s such a small issue and you find the need to report it to me? Deal with it yourself!”</p>  <p id = > Johann was enraged. ‘What the hell is up with Samuel?</p>  <p id = > ‘Is he growing old or is he just growing stupid?</p>  <p id = > ‘What Philip Clarke?</p>  <p id = > ‘Bankruptcy?</p>  <p id = > ‘What a joke!’</p>  <p id = > Samuel was quick to reply, “No, no, wait. Johann, my brother, I really don’t think I can deal with it myself.”</p>  <p id = > Johann frowned as he heard Samuel mutter over the phone. Pulling on his jacket, he walked to the study and asked, “Who is this man? A figure so powerful that you can’t deal with yourself?”</p>  <p id = > “You know of Arc de Triumph right, Johann?” Samuel asked.</p>  <p id = > “The hotel group you invested in? The one worth 20 billion in the market, right? What about it?”</p>  <p id = > “That Mr. Clarke, he bought all its shares. All 20 billion of it!”</p>  <p id = > ‘He bought it?</p>  <p id = > ‘20 billion!’</p>  <p id = > Johann’s frown deepened as he understood the gravity of the matter.</p>  <p id = > “Why does he want to buy your company, then? Did you offend him?” Johann had an immediate idea.</p>  <p id = > ‘The other party wants to buy Samuel’s companies, threatening bankruptcy too if he isn’t willing to sell. They must have enmity between them.’</p>  <p id = > Samuel muttered, “I don’t know yet. But I think Wesley might have had a conflict with him.”</p>  <p id = > “Then why the f*ck haven’t you gone over to take a look? Apologize if it’s required, compensate if you must. Does someone of his caliber look like what either of us can take? Idiot!”</p>  <p id = > Hanging up, he stood before his window as he smoked, unable to calm his heart.</p>  <p id = > Then, he dialed his secretary. “Check for a man by the name of Philip Clarke in Riverdale. I need the information as soon as possible.”</p>  <p id = > Samuel did not have time to dally either. Pulling on a top, he quickly left for Arc de Triumph Hotel.</p>  <p id = > At the same time, Wesley stood before Philip and his group with a face full of mockery. “As long as you prostrate before me and I hear a ‘Master Wesley’ coming from your mouth, I’ll let you go. But if you wish to continue your stubbornness, then I’m sorry, I don’t have the time to waste on you!”</p>  <p id = > Wesley was irked for he still had to meet the secret millionaire behind the 100 BMW motorcycles parked outside.</p>  <p id = > ‘Who has the time to waste on this f*cking idiot?’</p>  <p id = > Yet Philip watched him with an expression of serenity. “What’s the rush? Your dad should be on his way over.”</p>  <p id = > “My dad? What kind of f*cking joke is this? Why would my dad come here for you? What, are you gonna tell me next that my dad’s here to apologize to you?” Wesley snorted. “You can’t possibly think that this is some dumb f*cking novel plot where my father comes and begs you for forgiveness, can you? Wake up, Philip Clarke. Stop playing around.”</p>  <p id = > Philip did not answer. Instead, he opted to watch indifferently.</p>  <p id = > Right then, the doors to the hotel opened. Outside, a Mercedes-Benz was parking.</p>  <p id = > Out the car slowly jogged a middle-aged man.</p>  <p id = > Clad in a black shirt and white slacks, the man wore gold-rimmed glasses and clutched a briefcase next to his muffin top body. Cold sweat was perspiring all over his forehead.</p>  <p id = > “Dad! Why’re you here?”</p>  <p id = > Wesley paled at the arrival of the older man, his heart skipping a beat out of fear.</p>  <p id = > After entering the main doors, Samuel glared at Wesley. Irregarding everything else, he reached before Philip and spoke with a slouch and an apologetic smile, “My apologies for the tardiness, Mr. Clarke.”</p>  <p id = > Wesley, Zayn, and everyone else were shocked at the scene before them.</p>  <p id = > This was Samuel Warren, the chairman of Arc de Triumph’s Riverdale branch!</p>  <p id = > To think he would bend his back for a young man with the expression to flatter?</p>  <p id = > This was shocking news!</p>  <p id = > Wesley was especially shocked. He was dazed.</p>  <p id = > How could this be?</p>  <p id = > Philip nodded in return. Checking the time, he said, “You’re not tardy. You still have 20 minutes. I wonder what you, Mr. Warren, have decided to do in the end?”</p>  <p id = > Samuel Warren would naturally decline the offer. With a smile, he replied, “It’s not nice to joke about things like this, Mr. Clarke. Those companies of mine are mere small corporations. They have no future. They’ve been raking up losses after losses these few years. To sell them to you would be taking advantage of you.”</p>  <p id = > Wesley ran up right as his dad finished talking. In a frustrated tone, he yelled, “What the hell, Dad? Why are you being so polite to this dumb f*cker? What Mr. Clarke? He’s just a delivery boy! Aren’t you mixing him up with someone else?!”</p>     <h2 id =chapter-79 > Chapter 79</h2> <p id = > Slap!</p>  <p id = > A loud smack rang through the air.</p>  <p id = > At this instant, Samuel’s eyes were wide open as his face flared red with anger. He pointed a finger at Wesley and shouted furiously, “Shut up! You’re in no position to speak here. Scram!”</p>  <p id = > He blamed himself for this. He had spoiled his son too much and that was what cultivated this arrogant and defiant attitude of his.</p>  <p id = > “Dad, are you crazy! Why did you hit me?”</p>  <p id = > Wesley felt extremely wronged as he turned and glared at Philip resentfully before grumbling, “What the f*ck did you do? Why is my dad speaking to you like this!”</p>  <p id = > Philip said nothing.</p>  <p id = > Samuel, on the other hand, moved first. His hand went for Wesley’s cheek once more as he yelled, “Wesley Warren, shut your d*mn mouth! How can you speak to Mr. Clarke with that tone? Do you know that the ground you’re standing on now belongs to Mr. Clarke? The Arc de Triumph Group is now under Mr. Clarke. Now hurry up and apologize to Mr. Clarke!”</p>  <p id = > Wesley was completely stunned.</p>  <p id = > The Arc de Triumph Group was now Philip’s?</p>  <p id = > What… What was going on?</p>  <p id = > “I’m so sorry, Mr. Clarke. I didn’t teach my son how to behave himself. Please tell me what to do and we can settle this however you want.” Samuel knew that his move now would determine his life from today onward.</p>  <p id = > Philip stared into Wesley’s empty eyes and replied, “It’s fine, your son and I are old classmates.”</p>  <p id = > Old classmates?</p>  <p id = > Taken aback, Samuel quickly recovered with a smile and said, “Oh, that’s good. Wesley should thank his lucky stars for being able to have a classmate like you, Mr. Clarke.”</p>  <p id = > The flattery was making Philip extremely uncomfortable.</p>  <p id = > No way!</p>  <p id = > Impossible!</p>  <p id = > How did Philip get the money to purchase the Arch de Triumph Group?</p>  <p id = > He did not believe this!</p>  <p id = > He had already experienced living under Philip’s shadow during their college days.</p>  <p id = > Was Philip going to crush him once again?</p>  <p id = > He would not accept this!</p>  <p id = > “Wesley Warren, do you remember what I said just now? Life is a long journey. You never know who’s going to strike gold, do you?” Philip said with a small smile.</p>  <p id = > Flustered, Wesley stumbled back and fell to the ground. With a finger pointed at Philip’s face, he yelled, “That’s impossible! I’m Wesley Warren! You’ll never be able to beat me!”</p>  <p id = > Philip could not be bothered to entertain him any longer. He knew how unstable Wesley was at the moment.</p>  <p id = > Wesley had thought he was high above everyone else when all of a sudden, everything he once had turned into nothing. It was undeniably a huge blow to his ego.</p>  <p id = > Philip turned around and looked at Samuel. “Mr. Warren, you still have eight more minutes. Have you made up your mind?”</p>  <p id = > The edge of Samuel’s mouth twitched as he squeezed out a stiff smile. He was scared to even wipe away the nervous beads of sweat on his forehead. “Mr. Clarke, this isn’t right at all. Why don’t I get Wesley to apologize to you?”</p>  <p id = > “Hurry up and apologize to Mr. Clarke now!” Samuel yelled at Wesley whose mind seemed to have drifted away.</p>  <p id = > The confused and absent-minded Wesley was forced by Samuel to apologize to Philip.</p>  <p id = > However, Philip quickly spoke up, “Mr. Warren, sorry to interrupt but your son said earlier that if I can buy Arc de Triumph, he would kneel and kowtow to me.”</p>  <p id = > Samuel’s mouth twitched once again as his eyes went cold. Still, the smile remained plastered on his face as he responded, “Mr. Clarke, it’s not necessary to be so harsh, right? No matter what mistakes Wesley has made, there’s no need to humiliate him in public.”</p>  <p id = > “That’s not right, there’s no such thing. If I didn’t have the money and power that I have today, I know for sure that Wesley would be pressing my head to the ground and forcing me to kowtow to him at this very moment.</p>  <p id = > “Do the poor deserve to be bullied?</p>  <p id = > “Do the rich have the right to simply humiliate and insult others?</p>  <p id = > “Who gave you guys this right? The other rich people?</p>  <p id = > “Alright, then. Today, I, Philip Clarke, am a lot richer than you, so you must kneel down and apologize to me right now!”</p>  <p id = > Every word that Philip said in this one, long breath hit everyone straight in the heart.</p>  <p id = > Many of the people present right then were just average Joes. They had encountered unfortunate situations where they were bullied by the rich at least once in their life.</p>  <p id = > They never dared to fight back when they got trampled and humiliated by the rich.</p>  <p id = > Right now, however, Philip was speaking up for them. Naturally, they were happy.</p>  <p id = > “That’s right! Brother Phil, you’re right! Come on, kneel down and apologize now!”</p>  <p id = > “D*mn! I’ve never liked this idiot, Wesley. He’s always bullying us security guards all day. Does he think that we’re his dogs that he can just boss around? F*ck him, he deserves to have a taste of his own medicine!”</p>  <p id = > “Kneel down! Hurry up and kneel down!”</p>  <p id = > All of a sudden, the crowd was outraged.</p>  <p id = > Everyone was pointing at Wesley, which only made him even more terrified.</p>  <p id = > “Dad, help me! I don’t want to kneel down!” Wesley grabbed his father’s arm and hid behind him.</p>  <p id = > Samuel’s expression darkened as he said to Philip, “Mr. Clarke, do you really want to push this to the extreme? I suggest you think this through because I’m not someone to be pushed around. Mind you, I still have people behind me on my side. I’m not someone you want to provoke!”</p>  <p id = > Clearly, Samuel spoiled his son very much.</p>  <p id = > He would never let his son kneel before so many people to kowtow and apologize to someone else.</p>  <p id = > Philip laughed gently. “Well, I can’t wait to find out who are these people you speak about that I can’t provoke.”</p>  <h2 id =chapter-80 > Chapter 80</h2> <p id = > Samuel’s expression darkened even more after seeing how overbearing the other party was. He gritted his teeth and said angrily, “Mr. Clarke, please forgive where you may. There’s no need to be so extreme.”</p>  <p id = > Philip stared back quietly.</p>  <p id = > Samuel could not hold himself back anymore and lashed out in rage. “Philip Clarke, don’t you dare push your luck! I have been dealing in Riverdale for many years now. My net worth is beyond hundreds of millions! The people I know are those you absolutely can’t afford to provoke! If you know what’s best for you, leave this as it is, otherwise, I’ll be fighting you to the very end!”</p>  <p id = > He was truly enraged.</p>  <p id = > He had never suffered such an injustice in his life before. Even after taking a step back, the other party still refused to yield a step.</p>  <p id = > However, Philip remained silent.</p>  <p id = > “Alright, just wait and see!”</p>  <p id = > With that, Samuel dug out his phone and dialed Johann’s number. “Brother Johann, you must help me out! There’s a kid who’s determined to mess with me!”</p>  <p id = > On the other end of the phone, Johann was in his study. With a sullen face, he replied, “Hand him the phone. I’ll talk to him.”</p>  <p id = > Samuel’s eyes flashed and he quickly passed the phone to Philip. “He wants to speak to you.” He snorted.</p>  <p id = > Samuel knew that he would be fine as long as Brother Johann stepped out.</p>  <p id = > He believed that nobody could beat Brother Johann!</p>  <p id = > Hence, he quickly added. “Mr. Clarke, I hope that you’ll make a wise decision after answering this call.”</p>  <p id = > Philip cast Samuel a nonchalant glance before accepting the phone and held it by his ear.</p>  <p id = > Laughter sounded from the other end of the phone. “Mr. Clarke, what kind of trouble are you trying to stir up on this night? If Samuel and his son have done something that has offended you, let me apologize now on their behalf. How about that?”</p>  <p id = > Philip replied calmly, “Mr. Sullivan, what do you think will happen if evidence of your bribes and fraudulent bending of laws are exposed?”</p>  <p id = > It came at the least expected time.</p>  <p id = > Philip’s words pounded on Johann’s chest like a heavy hammer!</p>  <p id = > Johann immediately panicked.</p>  <p id = > He knew!</p>  <p id = > This man knew what he had done!</p>  <p id = > Bang!</p>  <p id = > Johann stood up from his seat abruptly as his voice deepened. His eyes went dark and cold in an instant. “Mr. Clarke, if you don’t have proof of what you’re saying, this is slander.”</p>  <p id = > “03762,” Philip spat out each digit slowly as he looked at the other phone in his hand.</p>  <p id = > Johann, on the other hand, immediately fell into his seat as his legs gave way. His eyes were filled with fear and panic while cold sweat formed across his forehead.</p>  <p id = > How was this possible?</p>  <p id = > This was his Swiss bank account!</p>  <p id = > Only he knew about the existence of this account, not even his wife knew about it!</p>  <p id = > Though somehow, this man found out about it!</p>  <p id = > What kind of power did this man have and where did he come from?</p>  <p id = > Seeing his straightforward manner, it was obvious that this man already knew about his secret deal with Samuel.</p>  <p id = > “Mr. Clarke, I think there’s still room for us to discuss,” Johann pleaded anxiously as his legs began to tremble violently. “Mr. Clarke, I won’t meddle in your business with Samuel anymore, but why don’t we meet each other and have a talk?”</p>  <p id = > It was time to give up a rook and save the king!</p>  <p id = > “Goodnight,” Philip replied coldly before passing the phone back to Samuel.</p>  <p id = > Samuel had a smirk on his face. Although he was unsure what had happened over the phone call, his past experiences told him that as long as he had Johann to back him up, nothing was impossible.</p>  <p id = > When he took the phone back in his hands, he quickly said, “Brother Johann, you always have a way…”</p>  <p id = > However, a loud bang that sounded like a door being burst open came from the phone.</p>  <p id = > “Johann Sullivan, you are a suspect of bribery and embezzlement. You are officially arrested. Please cooperate with us in our investigation!”</p>  <p id = > Thud!</p>  <p id = > The phone fell to the floor.</p>  <p id = > An alarming thought immediately weighed upon Samuel’s mind.</p>  <p id = > Was Johann caught?</p>  <p id = > How did this happen so quickly!</p>  <p id = > Johann was his backbone, the one always backing him up!</p>  <p id = > Samuel felt a stinging pinch to his spine. All of a sudden, he fell to the floor. He stared up at Philip with panic in his eyes as he stuttered, “You… Did you do this?”</p>  <p id = > Philip did not respond. He merely looked at the time and sent a text to George. ‘It’s time.’</p>  <p id = > Seeing the short, simple text, George quickly dialed a number he had prepared earlier.</p>  <p id = > All it took was three minutes.</p>  <p id = > Samuel began receiving multiple phone calls for help.</p>  <p id = > “Mr. Warren, something bad has happened! Our angel investors withdrew their investment. We lost 20 million!”</p>  <p id = > “Mr. Warren, I’m calling from New York. Our Series B funding fell through!”</p>  <p id = > “Mr. Warren, something terrible happened! The Bureau of Industry and Commerce and the Commercial Crime Investigation Department are here to investigate us. What should we do?”</p>  <p id = > One phone call after another, each of them bearing bad news!</p>  <p id = > Samuel remained slumped on the ground, his face as pale as a white sheet.</p>  <p id = > He was finished. Everything was over now!</p>  <p id = > “Dad, what’s going on? Dad, come on, say something!” Seeing the state his father was in, Wesley was shaking with fright.</p>  <p id = > Samuel suddenly jumped up and began giving Wesley bashes and kicks. He yelled, “You will be the death of me, you unfilial son! I’ll make sure that I beat you to death!”</p>  <p id = > The scene was total chaos.</p>  <p id = > Samuel began beating his son until the police arrived. They were both taken into the police car.</p>  <p id = > As the police car left the scene, everyone turned to Philip with a look of admiration in their eyes.</p>  <p id = > This man was amazing!</p>  <p id = > Agnes was tense. She had not expected Philip to have such courage and power!</p>  <p id = > She was by the sidelines the whole time, so she fully witnessed everything Philip had done.</p>  <p id = > This man was truly mysterious!</p>        <h2 id =chapter-81 > Chapter 81</h2> <p id = > The crowd dispersed and left the hotel.</p>  <p id = > Philip found a corner to smoke a cigarette so that he could relieve the pressure in his chest.</p>  <p id = > However, at that moment, a familiar voice sounded not far behind him.</p>  <p id = > “Philip, what are you doing here?”</p>  <p id = > Philip turned around and saw a puzzled Wynn walking toward him with her bag slung over her shoulder.</p>  <p id = > The look on her face showed that she was displeased.</p>  <p id = > Smoking again!</p>  <p id = > Philip quickly stubbed out the cigarette butt and greeted her with a sly smile. “Oh, I’m here for a company dinner.”</p>  <p id = > Philip was anxious and worried as he thought back to when Wynn contacted his other phone before.</p>  <p id = > He was worried that his true identity had been revealed.</p>  <p id = > Wynn walked closer to him and rolled her eyes as she asked, “Where’s Mila?”</p>  <p id = > “Someone from my company is bringing her. I’m meeting her in a bit,” Philip replied with a chuckle.</p>  <p id = > Suddenly, another familiar figure appeared before him.</p>  <p id = > “Philip, I didn’t expect to see you here.” Juan had just parked his car at the parking lot.</p>  <p id = > The tension in the air instantly thickened as their gazes met.</p>  <p id = > It was awkward yet hostile.</p>  <p id = > Knowing that the two of them were on each other’s bad side because of her, Wynn quickly turned to Philip and said coldly, “Go get Mila, then.”</p>  <p id = > With that, she turned around to leave.</p>  <p id = > Philip’s expression darkened as he responded in an equally icy tone, “What about you, then?”</p>  <p id = > Wynn paused before turning around. “I still have something to discuss with Juan, so I’ll probably be late tonight. Take care of Mila, will you?”</p>  <p id = > She was coming back late tonight?</p>  <p id = > How late was she talking about?</p>  <p id = > He was her husband. What did she mean by bringing Juan to Arc de Triumph for dinner right in front of his face?</p>  <p id = > Did she not know about the conflict between him and Juan?</p>  <p id = > Philip was slightly mad, so his expression stiffened in a flash.</p>  <p id = > As if on purpose, Juan patted Philip gently on his shoulder. “You should hurry up and go first, Philip. I still have some things to discuss with Wynn. Don’t worry, I’ll take good care of her and make sure she gets home safely.”</p>  <p id = > Smack!</p>  <p id = > Philip swiftly shrugged off Juan’s hand and grabbed him by the arm. He stared into Juan’s eyes coldly and said, “Juan, I’m warning you, don’t you dare try to make any foolish moves! I can assure you that I’ll make you regret it!”</p>  <p id = > “Philip, what the hell are you doing?!”</p>  <p id = > Wynn quickly pulled Philip away. With a stern glare, she ordered, “This is none of your business. You should go now.”</p>  <p id = > Philip was stunned. He did not expect Wynn to help Juan. His heart ached at this knowledge.</p>  <p id = > Still, he could not bring himself to hate Wynn.</p>  <p id = > Therefore, he directed his fury at Juan. “Parker, if you have anything to say, say it to me now! Don’t think that I don’t know what you’re thinking about! Mind you, I’m Wynn’s husband. Don’t you dare try anything stupid on her!”</p>  <p id = > Slap!</p>  <p id = > Wynn was so furious that she slapped Philip. “Are you crazy?! Do you even know what Juan and I are going to discuss? Can you not be so suspicious all the time? Quit making stories up in your head!” she screamed.</p>  <p id = > Tears brimmed the edge of her eyes as she forced herself to hold back her emotions.</p>  <p id = > She was meeting Juan today to borrow money!</p>  <p id = > Money for Mila’s medication.</p>  <p id = > However, Philip did not even try to understand the situation at all.</p>  <p id = > Right then, Juan sneered in an indifferent tone. “Philip, I thought too highly of you in the past. I didn’t expect you to be such a good-for-nothing scumbag! What a true man you are for making Wynn cry! I really don’t understand how someone like you is worthy of being Wynn’s husband and Mila’s father when you have neither money nor status!”</p>  <p id = > In the past, Juan and Philip were best friends who talked about everything.</p>  <p id = > They were brothers with a bond as strong as steel.</p>  <p id = > However, everything had changed in these past three to four years.</p>  <p id = > These two who were once brothers were now enemies.</p>  <p id = > “Alright, stop it!” Wynn shouted.</p>  <p id = > Then, she turned to Philip with a cold look in her eyes. “Philip, I’m very disappointed in you!”</p>  <p id = > Philip gave a wry, bitter laugh. He knew his place in Wynn’s heart.</p>  <p id = > He was just a piece of trash.</p>  <p id = > Was he really, though?</p>  <p id = > ‘Wynn Johnston, do you have any idea that your husband is the wealthiest man in this world!’</p>  <p id = > His family owned 70% of the property in this world!</p>  <p id = > The nation’s economy would stumble if he even just stomped his feet.</p>  <p id = > “Wynn, I know that you think I’m a piece of trash. All these years, I never gave you and Mila a good life, and I know it’s all my fault,” Philip said coldly, “But I’m telling you today that I’m not a useless piece of trash. I’ll prove it to you right here, right now! Money? Power and status? I have everything!”</p>  <p id = > With that, Philip started walking toward the parking lot.</p>  <p id = > There were almost 100 of BMW motorcycles parked in the lot along with 100 motorcyclists!</p>  <p id = > Wynn’s heart stopped for a second when she saw the scene before her.</p>  <p id = > What was he doing?</p>  <p id = > She could not possibly be held accountable for it if something were to happen.</p>  <p id = > Wynn quickly ran up as she screamed, “Philip Clarke, are you out of your mind!”</p>    <h2 id =chapter-82 > Chapter 82</h2> <p id = > Crazy!</p>  <p id = > Philip must have gone mad!</p>  <p id = > Was he allowed to enter that place?</p>  <p id = > Did he not see the parking lot filled with BMW motorcycles?</p>  <p id = > What was he planning to do?</p>  <p id = > Wynn quickly hurried behind Philip, worried that he would do something stupid.</p>  <p id = > Philip, on the other hand, was filled with annoyance.</p>  <p id = > He strode toward the parking lot and pushed away one of the motorcyclists standing beside his bike. Then, he snatched the helmet away from his hands.</p>  <p id = > Everyone naturally turned their gazes toward him.</p>  <p id = > With a helmet in one hand, Philip stretched out both arms as a conceited sneer spread across his face. He gestured to the parking lot full of BMW motorcycles and roared at Wynn who was running toward him and Juan who was standing in the corner, “Wynn, let me tell you this. All the BMW motorcycles in this very parking lot belong to me, Philip Clarke! I bought them all!”</p>  <p id = > His voice was as loud as rolling thunder as it echoed in the parking lot.</p>  <p id = > “And this, the Arc de Triumph Hotel, is mine! I just spent 20 billion to buy it!</p>  <p id = > “Haven’t you always thought of me as a good-for-nothing piece of trash? One who only knows how to deliver food? Let me tell you this, then. I spent 10 million to buy over Gopher Delivery Services just half a month ago! Gopher Delivery Services belongs to me, Philip Clarke!”</p>  <p id = > Clearly aggravated, Philip bellowed.</p>  <p id = > Juan frowned as a look flashed in his eyes.</p>  <p id = > Wynn, however, was utterly stunned. A moment later, she recovered and rushed toward Philip, giving him a loud, stinging slap on his face. “Philip Clarke, are you finished! What the hell do you want? Are you happy now that you have embarrassed yourself in front of so many people!”</p>  <p id = > Wynn was really furious!</p>  <p id = > How could this happen? How did Philip turn out this way?</p>  <p id = > “Stop fooling around and go back now! Go away!”</p>  <p id = > Wynn had burst into tears as she shoved Philip away with all her might.</p>  <p id = > Right this moment, Philip looked like a clown in despair.</p>  <p id = > He watched as Wynn broke down before him, punching and shoving him fiercely while cursing at him.</p>  <p id = > Philip’s breathing became harder and harder. He was unsure of what to do.</p>  <p id = > Several people had gathered around to watch them as if they were watching a show. They were all pointing and talking about Philip.</p>  <p id = > “Look, that man’s crazy. He must be hallucinating!”</p>  <p id = > “I have never seen anything like this. Does he have any shame at all?”</p>  <p id = > “If I was in his shoes, I would certainly dig myself a hole and hide there forever.”</p>  <p id = > The crowd stared at Philip and Wynn with an odd, complex look.</p>  <p id = > Right at that moment, a few hooligans ran out from the other end of the parking lot.</p>  <p id = > Leading the pack was a fierce-looking man with tattoos all over his body. He pointed at Philip and yelled, “Are you Philip Clarke?”</p>  <p id = > Startled, Philip quickly pulled Wynn behind him as he frowned. “Who are you?”</p>  <p id = > He did not know these people, but he could tell that they were up to no good.</p>  <p id = > “You don’t have to know who the f*ck I am but Tiger gave out orders today to teach you a good lesson! Come on, beat him up!”</p>  <p id = > The tattooed man waved his hand at the group of burly men behind him. Several men immediately dashed forward and grabbed Philip.</p>  <p id = > Although Philip resisted the attack, he was quickly pressed to the ground by the opponent as he was concerned about Wynn.</p>  <p id = > Philip buried his head in his hands and arched his back involuntarily, allowing himself to be hit by the punches and kicks thrown his way.</p>  <p id = > Wynn had been pushed out of the chaos, but after seeing Philip getting beaten up, she rushed forward as she cried out, “Stop it! Please stop it!”</p>  <p id = > It was total chaos.</p>  <p id = > Among the gang of hooligans, there was one particular person whose mouth stuck out. He had a chin like an ape’s. A cold look flashed in the corner of his eyes.</p>  <p id = > Swish!</p>  <p id = > He pulled out a switch-blade knife from his pocket and dashed toward Philip, aiming the knife at him!</p>  <p id = > However…</p>  <p id = > He missed!</p>  <p id = > Well, not exactly… There was too much going on!</p>  <p id = > Stab!</p>  <p id = > The switch-blade knife penetrated Wynn’s abdomen!</p>  <p id = > Bright red blood flowed from the stab wound and Wynn’s white blouse turned red within seconds.</p>  <p id = > Thump!</p>  <p id = > Wynn brought her hand to her abdomen as she fell to the ground with tears in her eyes.</p>  <p id = > Philip was dumbfounded.</p>  <p id = > He dropped to the ground beside her as he stared blankly while Wynn laid in a pool of blood.</p>  <p id = > At that moment, he forgot how to breathe and his heart stopped beating.</p>                     <h2 id =chapter-83 > Chapter 83</h2> <p id = > “Wynn! Honey!”</p>  <p id = > Philip snarled like a maniac as he pounced forward to hold Wynn, pressing his hands hard on her abdomen. “Don’t be afraid, it’ll be alright! You’ll be alright!”</p>  <p id = > Wynn’s lips had turned white as layers of cold sweat beaded her forehead.</p>  <p id = > It hurt!</p>  <p id = > The hooligans instantly panicked as well and fled the scene without hesitation.</p>  <p id = > It was a mess. People were taking pictures and videos to post on the internet but nobody made any calls.</p>  <p id = > Juan chased behind the men but soon returned with his phone. “Hello, I’m calling from Arc de Triumph Hotel. Someone has been injured here, please send help right now! Hurry up please!”</p>  <p id = > Without thinking through, Philip carried Wynn in his arms and rushed out of the parking lot like a madman. He stopped a taxi and yelled in the driver’s face, “To the hospital! Quick, to the hospital!”</p>  <p id = > The driver remained calm and collected as he sped toward the hospital.</p>  <p id = > However, it was the evening rush hour, so traffic was extremely congested!</p>  <p id = > Time was running out!</p>  <p id = > With Wynn still in his arms, Philip jumped out of the car and began running.</p>  <p id = > The stab wound on Wynn’s abdomen continued bleeding, turning Philip’s sweat-stained shirt a shade of bloody red.</p>  <p id = > “Doctor! I need a doctor here! I need help!”</p>  <p id = > The second Philip rushed into Riverdale Public Hospital, he dropped to his knees on the ground and started yelling.</p>  <p id = > Several medical staff at the emergency room came to help with a gurney and quickly pushed Wynn into the emergency room.</p>  <p id = > …</p>  <p id = > Ten minutes later.</p>  <p id = > Philip sat in the corridor outside the emergency room feeling paralyzed. He kept pulling his hair frantically as he muttered under his breath, “It’ll be fine, nothing will happen to her.”</p>  <p id = > At that moment, his mother and father-in-law, Martha and Charles, arrived at the hospital after hearing the news.</p>  <p id = > “What happened? What are the doctors doing now?”</p>  <p id = > Martha was as anxious as ants on a hot pan as she hurried past Philip, sticking herself to the emergency room door in an attempt to see what was going on.</p>  <p id = > “Philip, what happened? Can you say something?” Charles shouted angrily at Philip who was slumped on the ground.</p>  <p id = > Right then, Martha came around and rushed over. She pulled Philip up and screamed at him, “Philip, what’s going on? Why is Wynnie in the emergency room? Talk to me! Say something!”</p>  <p id = > Philip was too shaken to speak.</p>  <p id = > At that moment, Juan arrived as well. When he came over, he flung his arm at Philip and punched Philip in the face. Then, he swiftly grabbed Philip by the collar and yelled to his face, “Philip Clarke, it’s all your fault! Why did you tell all those lies? Why! Who are those people? What kind of people have you offended outside? I swear I’m not going to forgive you if something happens to Wynn!”</p>  <p id = > When Martha heard that Philip was the one who caused this incident, she immediately stepped forward and slapped Philip multiple times. “Philip Clarke, I’ll make sure you pay with your life if I lose my daughter!”</p>  <p id = > Martha’s blood pressure instantly rose along with her rage. She clutched her chest as she staggered backward.</p>  <p id = > “Aunty, are you alright?” Juan reacted swiftly and rushed forward to help Martha sit down.</p>  <p id = > As Martha slowly sat down, she continued scolding Philip, “You… Go away! I want you and Wynn to get a divorce! I’ll have her divorce you!”</p>  <p id = > Charles, who was standing by the side, was extremely worried about his daughter’s condition and at the same time incredibly disgusted by Philip’s presence.</p>  <p id = > Fuming, he glared at the silent Philip who had his head down the entire time. He yelled, “I must have been blind to have allowed my daughter to marry a piece of trash like you! Scram! Get away from my sight this instant!”</p>  <p id = > Philip looked up at his furious in-laws and apologized. “I’m sorry, it’s my fault. I’ll bear all the consequences myself if something were to happen to Wynn.”</p>  <p id = > Martha’s heart ached when she heard his words. She pointed her finger at Philip’s nose and continued screaming, “You good-for-nothing piece of trash! You waste your time idling around all day long. Not only are you incapable of doing anything, you just had to stir up trouble outside! How did my daughter end up with someone as useless as you? God, why are you torturing me? What evil have I done to the point that you’re punishing my daughter with an unlucky scumbag like him?”</p>  <p id = > “You and that bastard of yours should leave our Johnston family immediately. We don’t have a son-in-law with you, nor do we have that granddaughter!”</p>  <p id = > Martha fell to the bench once again, her arm clutching her chest as she panted heavily.</p>  <p id = > Her words were ruthless and harsh.</p>  <p id = > Still, Philip endured it all.</p>  <p id = > He was the one who started all of this.</p>  <p id = > Juan saw everything that happened from the side and sneered coldly. Realizing that he had the upper hand now, he quickly stepped forward and shoved Philip away. “Can you scram now? Or do you want the two elders to die from rage?”</p>  <p id = > Philip knew that if he stayed here any longer, he would only aggravate the two elders.</p>  <p id = > However, he could not stop worrying about Wynn.</p>  <p id = > After approximately half an hour, the emergency room’s doors were flung open as the doctors walked out.</p>  <p id = > With Juan’s help, Martha hobbled forward. Tears filled her eyes as she asked anxiously, “Doctor, is my daughter alright?”</p>  <p id = > The doctor nodded in response. “She’s fine now. If the wound had been an inch deeper, it would have been a lot more complicated. Fortunately, she was sent here in time, so we were able to save her. You should go handle the formalities now.”</p>  <p id = > Martha gasped in horror when she heard the doctor’s words. She grasped the doctor’s hands tightly and said gratefully, “Thank you, doctor. Thank you so much!”</p>  <p id = > Philip’s face paled even more when he saw Wynn being pushed out of the emergency room.</p>  <p id = > He wanted to move forward and check on her, but he was immediately stopped by Martha as she sent another slap to his face. “Why are you still standing here? We don’t want to see you anymore, you jinx!”</p>  <p id = > Philip had no choice but to watch from afar. After making sure that Wynn looked fine, he apologized a couple more times before turning to leave.</p>  <p id = > When he walked out of the hospital, a few black S-class Mercedes-Benzs were lined up right outside the hospital entrance. The shiny cars glimmered in the dark, looking extremely dazzling.</p>  <p id = > Standing by the door of one of the cars was George, decked in an all-black suit. He had his golden-black cane in hand as he waited patiently and respectfully in a deep bow.</p>  <p id = > The instant Philip left the hospital doors, the despair within him immediately dissipated into the air and was replaced with a sense of never-before-seen fierceness.</p>  <p id = > This sense of fierceness had not once appeared in the past seven years.</p>  <p id = > George bowed even lower.</p>  <p id = > He knew that the young master of the Clarke family had returned at this moment.</p>  <p id = > Philip got into the car with a steely expression on his face that showed no sign of any emotions. “Where are they?”</p>  <p id = > George sat down beside Philip, his grave expression matching Philip’s as he replied, “They have already been caught. They’re in the yard now.”</p>                 <h2 id =chapter-84 > Chapter 84</h2> <p id = > Philip’s eyes were ice-cold, his demeanor daunting.</p>  <p id = > George dared not speak at all as he kept quiet. This demeanor of his that had disappeared for seven whole years was finally revealed once again at this very moment.</p>  <p id = > Tonight, the gang of hooligans was about to face the wrath of a dragon that had just awakened from the abyss.</p>  <p id = > “Drive,” George ordered.</p>  <p id = > The S-class sedans slowly drove away from the hospital grounds, still lined up together.</p>  <p id = > Meanwhile, Lynn and her parents who were walking briskly toward the hospital entrance coincidentally passed by Philip’s car.</p>  <p id = > Being the money-obsessed woman she was, Lynn could not help but eye the five to six luxury sedans as they drove past her. The cars were especially impossible to miss at nighttime.</p>  <p id = > Who was this rich man?</p>  <p id = > Lynn’s heart immediately jumped when she saw the car occupant’s face.</p>  <p id = > The person sitting in the car that just drove past her was no other than her good-for-nothing brother-in-law, Philip Clarke.</p>  <p id = > Lynn was stunned in place as her brows furrowed. She turned back to the convoy of sedans that were driving out of the hospital’s gate as she wondered to herself.</p>  <p id = > “Is it really him?”</p>  <p id = > How was that possible though?</p>  <p id = > She had to be overthinking.</p>  <p id = > Lynn was clear what kind of person her brother-in-law was.</p>  <p id = > How could he be sitting in a luxury sedan being the piece of trash that he was?</p>  <p id = > Lynn chuckled to herself and shrugged the thought away before running into the hospital.</p>  <p id = > On the other end, the convoy of sedans soon arrived at an estate that had been personally bought by George.</p>  <p id = > To be exact, Philip was the one who paid for it.</p>  <p id = > The estate was located in the most expensive region in Riverdale. Only a total of 30 pieces of land were developed with the cheapest one priced at 30 million!</p>  <p id = > The land which George had purchased was the most expensive one. It was based in the central region with unique features.</p>  <p id = > He had spent a whopping total of 100 million on this piece of land!</p>  <p id = > Of course, the only real estate development company capable of exploiting this piece of land was the best local enterprise in Riverdale—Longford Group.</p>  <p id = > Being a local enterprise that had stood firmly for 40 years, Longford Group always had speaking rights and certain influence in Riverdale.</p>  <p id = > Nobody could possibly imagine the capital and power that existed behind the scenes.</p>  <p id = > It was not about the amount of money involved but the intricate chain of relationships.</p>  <p id = > In terms of money, George was the richest man in Riverdale.</p>  <p id = > However, in terms of power, Longford Group was undeniably the local tyrant.</p>  <p id = > Even Theo Zander had to depend on their favor when handling affairs.</p>  <p id = > The convoy of cars soon arrived at Longford Park. There were three gates altogether, each of which was being guarded by specially trained security guards from Longford Group.</p>  <p id = > Safety was certainly not an issue.</p>  <p id = > Eventually, the cars came to a stop in the central region of the estate. They had arrived at First Palace.</p>  <p id = > The name was indeed domineering.</p>  <p id = > Philip got out of the car and was greeted by his security guards, all of whom were dressed in a black suit and black shades. They stood ten meters apart from each other on either side of the thousand-acre piece of land.</p>  <p id = > Kneeling in the center of the grounds in the headlights were the five young hooligans from before who were now shivering in fright.</p>  <p id = > There was no change in Philip’s indifferent expression as he stepped nearer toward them. He grabbed a baseball bat from the hands of one of the security guards and swung it down fiercely on the men!</p>  <p id = > This went on for the next five minutes.</p>  <p id = > Screams and howls broke through the air one after another.</p>  <p id = > Clang!</p>  <p id = > The baseball bat was thrown to the ground as Philip took a seat on the jade white marble bench. With his legs wide apart, he bent his upper body forward as both his arms hung loosely. “Which one of you was the one with the knife?” he asked in an ice-cold tone as he glared at the five men sprawled across the ground.</p>  <p id = > “It wasn’t me! It wasn’t me!”</p>  <p id = > “It wasn’t me either! Brother, please forgive us!”</p>  <p id = > “We won’t dare to do this anymore! We know our faults now, please forgive us!”</p>  <p id = > Philip’s expression remained dark and stern as the men begged and pleaded. He snapped his fingers at the guards and a few of them stepped forward, each one of them carrying a silver box in their hands. They proceeded to lift the lids up, revealing stacks of red banknotes inside.</p>  <p id = > “I have five million here. Whoever speaks up first will have all of it.”</p>  <p id = > Although his voice was soft, the effect was astounding.</p>  <p id = > The young hooligans exchanged glances as each one of them conspired their own thoughts.</p>  <p id = > “I’ll talk!”</p>  <p id = > “No, let me talk!”</p>  <p id = > “It was him! Woody did it!”</p>  <p id = > Within seconds, four of them were pointing their fingers at the same person.</p>  <p id = > The man who was singled out was terrified and trembling all over. He continued shouting that it was not him, and he tried to get up from the floor to run away.</p>  <p id = > Thump!</p>  <p id = > A kick sent him flying to the air, making him drop to the ground once again. He clutched his abdomen as cold sweat formed on his forehead.</p>  <p id = > Philip sneered as he remained seated on the jade white marble bench. “I don’t want to see his face ever again in Riverdale.”</p>  <p id = > As soon as the words came out from his mouth, two of the black-suited security guards moved forward and dragged a terrified and trembling Woody away.</p>  <p id = > Woody desperately begged for mercy, “Brother, please forgive me! Big Boss, I know that I’ve done wrong. I’m sorry!”</p>  <p id = > Rumble!</p>  <p id = > A muffled clap of thunder echoed in the air, masking all the surrounding sounds.</p>  <p id = > Somewhere in a corner of Riverdale, a black van was speeding under the heavy rain when one of the car doors opened as a body covered with blood was thrown out from the vehicle.</p>  <p id = > Both his legs were broken after getting thrown into puddles of mud. He was howling in agony.</p>  <p id = > From that moment on, Riverdale was home to another crippled beggar.</p>           <h2 id =chapter-85 > Chapter 85</h2> <p id = > Back at First Palace.</p>  <p id = > Philip stood firmly under the pouring rain with two of his bodyguards by his side holding umbrellas over him, his demeanor stern and threatening.</p>  <p id = > Meanwhile, four men were left on the grass. One or two were on their knees while the rest were crumpled on the ground.</p>  <p id = > They had no clue that the person they were supposed to beat up was someone who was not to be provoked.</p>  <p id = > They were beyond terrified.</p>  <p id = > “Who’s Tiger?” Philip finally asked. His tone was as cold as the devil’s, and one could not help but cower at the harshness in his tone.</p>  <p id = > “Tiger, Tiger Zander of Lord North Street,” one of them spat out as he continued shaking with fear.</p>  <p id = > A cold look flashed in Philip’s eyes.</p>  <p id = > On the other hand, George who was standing behind Philip under the umbrella let out a deep sigh as he pulled out his phone to call Theo.</p>  <p id = > In the meantime.</p>  <p id = > At Theo’s manor.</p>  <p id = > It was the middle of the night when he received a call from an anxious Tiger saying that something bad had happened.</p>  <p id = > When he opened the door, he was greeted by Tiger kneeling outside the door under the heavy rain.</p>  <p id = > “Tiger, what are you doing here?” Theo quickly rushed out to help him up.</p>  <p id = > However, Tiger remained on his knees under the rain, showing no signs of moving. His head was bowed low, and he was drenched from head to toe.</p>  <p id = > “Theo, I’m sorry. I screwed up,” Tiger yelled as he tightened his fists.</p>  <p id = > After his henchmen were caught, he began asking around until he received terrible news.</p>  <p id = > The target he had asked his henchmen to go after was Mr. Clarke!</p>  <p id = > At that instant, Tiger felt as if he had fallen into a bottomless pit.</p>  <p id = > What frightened him even more was that one of his henchmen had acted rashly and stabbed the woman who was supposedly Mr. Clarke’s wife.</p>  <p id = > He was as good as dead now!</p>  <p id = > Tiger well understood how badly Theo feared Mr. Clarke too.</p>  <p id = > Although he was unsure of Mr. Clarke’s true background, the one thing he was certain of was that he was a dead man.</p>  <p id = > Theo panicked and quickly asked, “What the hell happened? Come in and we’ll talk about it.”</p>  <p id = > Theo had never felt this perturbed. His instincts were telling him that something terribly bad must have happened.</p>  <p id = > Otherwise, knowing Tiger’s temperament, there was no way he would be kneeling in front of his door in the middle of the night pleading guilty.</p>  <p id = > Tiger stayed still under the rainstorm as he came clean about everything from the beginning to the end.</p>  <p id = > Kick!</p>  <p id = > Splash!</p>  <p id = > Seething with rage, Theo kicked Tiger in the chest and sent him falling into the puddles of water.</p>  <p id = > “You idiot! Why the f*ck would you do such a thing?! Why! Do you have a f*cking death wish! You idiot!!!”</p>  <p id = > Theo shrieked at Tiger under the rain, his chest filled with indescribable anger.</p>  <p id = > He could not believe what he had just heard.</p>  <p id = > Tiger had asked his henchmen to teach Mr. Clarke a lesson and accidentally stabbed Mr. Clarke’s woman while at it…</p>  <p id = > Damn it!</p>  <p id = > He had literally dug himself a grave!</p>  <p id = > “Theo! I’m sorry, I’ll bear all the consequences myself! Please spare my family! Theo, please tell Mr. Clarke to spare my family!”</p>  <p id = > Tiger stayed on his knees under the rain as he slammed his head harshly on the ground, each kowtow a sharp blow on Theo’s chest.</p>  <p id = > Rumble! Rumble!</p>  <p id = > With the thunderstorm raging on, perhaps God was furious as well.</p>  <p id = > Theo was just about to pick up his phone when it started ringing.</p>  <p id = > The caller ID showed that it was Mr. Thomas calling.</p>  <p id = > Theo’s heart jolted as he quickly accepted the call. “Mr. Thomas, is there anything you need?” His tone was respectful with a hint of fear.</p>  <p id = > “Is Tiger with you now?”</p>  <p id = > It was a simple yes or no question, yet Theo hesitated for a long moment before replying, “Yes.”</p>  <p id = > “Bring him to First Palace in Longford Park immediately. Mr. Clarke would like to see him.”</p>  <p id = > Click.</p>  <p id = > The call ended.</p>  <p id = > Theo was stunned for a very long time before he finally recovered.</p>  <p id = > “Let’s go, we have to see Mr. Clarke now,” Theo said coldly as he started the car and sped toward Longford Park.</p>  <p id = > About ten minutes later, Theo arrived at First Palace along with Tiger who was soaking wet.</p>  <p id = > The rain had gotten smaller by then.</p>  <p id = > The second Tiger saw Mr. Clarke who was seated on the jade white marble bench, he immediately fell on his knees and kowtowed. “Mr. Clarke, please spare my family. I’ll bear all the consequences!”</p>  <p id = > Philip stared blankly at Tiger who was kneeling on the ground before him.</p>  <p id = > He had seen something similar not long ago.</p>  <p id = > The person before him was just a man.</p>  <p id = > A man was bound to make mistakes at times.</p>  <p id = > Philip turned sideways to look at Theo who stood beside Tiger and asked coldly, “Theo, what would you do?”</p>  <p id = > Theo bowed courteously and lowered his head. “We shall deal with this on your terms, Mr. Clarke.”</p>  <p id = > Philip said nothing as he got up. He stepped in front of Tiger and looked down at him grimly. “Tiger, why did you send your henchmen to teach me a lesson?”</p>  <p id = > Tiger dared not hide anything and revealed everything about Ruby.</p>  <p id = > When Philip finished listening to his story, he clenched his fists tightly as a cold gleam flashed in his eyes.</p>  <p id = > Ruby Ford!</p>  <p id = > This woman certainly did not know when to give up!</p>  <p id = > Philip stood quietly, seemingly deep in thought as the silence pressed on everyone’s chest like a heavy stone.</p>  <p id = > After a long while, he finally spoke, “You can go, but don’t you dare repeat the same mistake.”</p>  <p id = > Tiger was utterly stunned for a moment. He could not believe what he just heard.</p>  <p id = > He swiftly recovered from the shock and kowtowed. “Thank you, Mr. Clarke! Thank you so much!”</p>  <p id = > Theo heaved a deep breath of relief. The load that had been bearing on his mind was finally lifted. He bowed as well and said, “Mr. Clarke…”</p>  <p id = > Before he could finish his sentence, George sent him a stern glare and Theo quickly pulled Tiger away.</p>  <p id = > When they were gone, George asked, “Young Master, why did you decide to spare Tiger?”</p>  <p id = > Philip replied, “I’m not a person who enjoys the cruelty of fighting and killing. Tiger didn’t do it on purpose, so he doesn’t deserve to die. Now that Wynn is short of a bodyguard, Tiger can take over and take this as an opportunity to redeem himself.”</p>  <p id = > George nodded his head slowly. After a long pause, he spoke again while his hands trembled slightly, “Young Master, you’re back.”</p>  <p id = > Philip cast him a side glance when he heard George’s words. An indescribable look of disbelief flashed in his eyes as his brows furrowed. “I don’t really like the me you’re talking about.”</p>  <p id = > At this moment, his phone rang. As soon as the call was connected, the angry voice of his mother-in-law, Martha, boomed through the other end.</p>  <p id = > “Philip, where the hell did you go? Wynnie wants to see you, so get back to the hospital right now!”</p>  <p id = > Click!</p>  <p id = > With that, she ended the call.</p>  <p id = > His cold and chilly demeanor instantly vanished into thin air. All of a sudden, Philip returned to the man who had been constantly humiliated and insulted for the past two to three years.</p>  <p id = > He was just an average man.</p>  <p id = > “Get me to the hospital,” Philip said urgently.</p>  <p id = > George could not help but shake his head helplessly. The young master he recognized seconds ago had disappeared once again.</p>  <p id = > After sending Philip to the hospital, George felt an overwhelming sense of helplessness as he watched his anxious young master scramble down the car. He pulled out his phone and dialed a number. “Old Master, I think it’s time to tell Young Master everything.”</p>       <h2 id =chapter-86 > Chapter 86</h2> <p id = > Philip ran straight into the hospital. His face instantly paled when he saw Wynn lying in the hospital bed.</p>  <p id = > There were a few other people gathered in the room.</p>  <p id = > His mother and father-in-law, Martha and Charles, stared at Philip unpleasantly. They desperately wished for this good-for-nothing to disappear from their life forever.</p>  <p id = > Lynn and her parents were present in the room as well, each of them giving Philip an odd look as if he had committed a huge mistake while they muttered to each other under their breaths.</p>  <p id = > “How’s Wynn?” Philip asked as he jogged toward the hospital bed.</p>  <p id = > However…</p>  <p id = > Slap!</p>  <p id = > A crisp smack rang through the air.</p>  <p id = > Martha had slapped Philip across the face angrily. Her face turned red with anger as she set her frosty gaze on him. “How dare you show your face here again? Look what you did to Wynnie! I will never forgive you if anything happens to my daughter!”</p>  <p id = > Martha shrieked as she began throwing punches at Philip, venting all her anger and grievances on him.</p>  <p id = > Philip merely endured it. He did not fight back, nor did he move at all.</p>  <p id = > Charles cast Philip an indifferent look as he gently pulled Martha away. He turned to Philip and said in a reprimanding tone, “Philip, we Johnstons can’t tolerate you any longer. I think you and my daughter should get a divorce. You can go anywhere you want and do whatever you like, we won’t care anymore. You should bring Mila with you too. The two of you father and daughter should stop holding my daughter back. I asked you here to tell you this and nothing else. As long as you nod your head this instant, I’ll give you 500,000 for Mila’s medical bills. After all, she’s still partially the flesh and blood of the Johnston family.”</p>  <p id = > The room fell silent and the tension in the air thickened right after Charles finished talking.</p>  <p id = > Everyone was waiting for Philip’s decision.</p>  <p id = > However, Philip did not say a word.</p>  <p id = > He would never divorce Wynn.</p>  <p id = > At this moment, Lynn added with a sarcastic sneer. “Brother-in-law, I think you should take the offer. You have put my cousin through so much trouble in the past three years, I think it’s time for you to let go. My cousin has a lot of pursuers, so if you love her, you should give her a better future. Someone like you can never give my cousin a good life.”</p>  <p id = > ‘Worthless wretch!</p>  <p id = > ‘How dare you still have the audacity to stand there quietly like a block of wood!</p>  <p id = > ‘A man like you should be embarrassed! ‘</p>  <p id = > She looked down on Philip even more when she remembered what had happened earlier today at the BMW store.</p>  <p id = > Lynn’s father chimed in as well, “Philip, I don’t want to say too much but you can’t go on like this. You’ll just drag Wynn down with you. Why don’t you get a divorce with Wynn and I’ll give you 100,000 bucks? Just think of it as some money for Mila’s medical bills. What do you think?”</p>  <p id = > Lynn’s mother immediately cast her husband a stern glare when she heard his words. She tugged him by his elbow as her expression darkened. “What are you talking about? How are we supposed to dig out 100,000 bucks? Can you think of yourself before you make any silly decisions!” she muttered under her breath.</p>  <p id = > Then, she raised her voice slightly as she continued, “Philip, we don’t have that much money, so don’t even think about it. Your uncle has had too much to drink.”</p>  <p id = > Obviously, Philip would not think too much about it.</p>  <p id = > He knew how disgusting these people could be.</p>  <p id = > He still remembered how this woman treated him when he went to her to borrow money back when Mila had just gotten sick.</p>  <p id = > Everyone in the room took turns adding their personal input, clearly ignoring Philip.</p>  <p id = > Each of them added a word to his humiliation.</p>  <p id = > He was the most hateful person in this family and everyone thought he deserved to be punished.</p>  <p id = > Philip stood there silently as he endured the harsh words. His fists were tightly clenched while he watched Wynn who was lying on the hospital bed.</p>  <p id = > Philip took a deep breath before finally raising his head. “Father, Mother, I won’t divorce Wynn. I won’t agree with this and I’m sure Wynn won’t either.”</p>  <p id = > “You don’t agree?”</p>  <p id = > Martha’s response came out as a high-pitched screech as she pointed at Philip before cursing at him, “What right do you have to say such things to my face? You and Wynn are getting divorced, and that’s the end of the discussion! I’m taking her to the Civil Affairs Bureau the second she wakes up! There’s no you and me here. It’s just that simple!”</p>  <p id = > There was no hint of warmth in Martha’s eyes, just pure rage.</p>  <p id = > She had tolerated Philip for three whole years. She had held onto hope for three long years.</p>  <p id = > Yet, he was still the good-for-nothing piece of trash that he was.</p>  <p id = > He would never be good enough.</p>  <p id = > If this went on, Wynn would go down together with this pair of father and daughter.</p>  <p id = > That would not do! For the sake of her daughter’s happiness, Martha must settle this tonight once and for all so that she could grow old rest assured.</p>  <p id = > Martha liked Aiden very much. After all, he was a good guy. Though, Wynn did not share the same feelings.</p>  <p id = > Even if Wynn turned Aiden down, there was still Juan. His family was in the jade business line, so not only was he extremely wealthy, he was one of the prominent figures in Riverdale too.</p>  <p id = > Only a man as outstanding was worthy enough to be Martha’s son-in-law, and only would a man this excellent be capable of providing her daughter a good life.</p>  <p id = > Philip was utterly speechless. He had not expected Martha to be so unreasonable and lash out like that.</p>  <p id = > “Mother, I…” Philip stuttered.</p>  <p id = > Slap!</p>  <p id = > Martha flung her hand forward until it came in contact with his cheek and screamed loudly, “Don’t you dare call me Mother! I don’t have a son-in-law like you!”</p>  <p id = > How dare he have the audacity to call her that!</p>  <p id = > Martha was so angry that her blood boiled with rage.</p>       <h2 id =chapter-87 > Chapter 87</h2> <p id = > Listening to Philip's scream felt as painful as having thorns all over your body.</p>  <p id = > When Philip stopped talking, the atmosphere in the ward became heavy.</p>  <p id = > Just then, Juan, who had gone out, returned. He saw that everyone was present, including Philip.</p>  <p id = > “How dare you come here?” Juan grabbed Philip angrily by his collar. “Haven’t you done enough to Wynn? Why are you even here?”</p>  <p id = > Juan did not want to see someone as useless as Philip here.</p>  <p id = > If it were not for him wanting to show off, would Wynn be in the state she was in now?</p>  <p id = > Philip shook free of Juan’s grasp and glared at him, his eyes dark as he spoke, “Juan, what business do you have here? Wynn is my wife, you get out of here!”</p>  <p id = > When in front of his in-laws, Philip had no choice.</p>  <p id = > However, in front of Juan, he could never be vulnerable.</p>  <p id = > “Shut up!”</p>  <p id = > Charles spoke up at this point. He pointed toward the door as he bellowed at Philip, “You’re the one who needs to get out!”</p>  <p id = > Lynn watched in silence as she tapped on her phone, reporting what was happening to her friends in the group chat. The corners of her lips were curled up in a sarcastic smile.</p>  <p id = > She also took a few photos sneakily and sent them to the group.</p>  <p id = > The chat became filled with sarcastic remarks for a short while.</p>  <p id = > Being with such wimps was suffocating.</p>  <p id = > Juan tugged on the collar of his suit, his face full of ridicule and smugness as he said, “Philip Clarke, I despise you. If you’re still a man, it’s time to end this today. As long as you divorce Wynn, I’ll take care of the expenses required for Mila’s treatment, including the cost needed for subsequent treatments.”</p>  <p id = > Juan was arrogant and defiant.</p>  <p id = > Standing in front of Philip, he had the confidence to be arrogant.</p>  <p id = > Philip’s eyebrows locked together tightly as his heart went cold.</p>  <p id = > Juan Parker had really gone too far!</p>  <p id = > It was then that Wynn, who had been unconscious on the hospital bed, regained consciousness.</p>  <p id = > Everyone crowded around her concernedly.</p>  <p id = > However, Philip was excluded from the crowd.</p>  <p id = > Every time he tried to get closer, Martha would glare at him angrily.</p>  <p id = > “Wynn, how are you feeling? Tell me if there’s anywhere else you feel uncomfortable, I’ll call for the doctor.” Martha held on worriedly to Wynn’s hand, her concern evident on her face.</p>  <p id = > “Wynn, are you alright? Tell me if you need anything, I’ll go buy it for you.” Juan seemed to be exceptionally concerned.</p>  <p id = > Standing at the side, Lynn faked a look of concern on her face. “Cousin, are you okay?”</p>  <p id = > Wynn got up slowly and leaned against the bed, looking dispirited and very weak.</p>  <p id = > The pain that tore through her abdomen made it difficult for her to speak.</p>  <p id = > “Where’s Philip?” That was the first question that left Wynn’s mouth.</p>  <p id = > “Why are you still talking about that loser?” Martha sulked as she cursed.</p>  <p id = > She could not believe how foolish her daughter was, asking for Philip the moment she woke up.</p>  <p id = > It was so infuriating!</p>  <p id = > Wynn’s cheeks throbbed with pain, and her face became very pale as she spoke, “Where is he?”</p>  <p id = > At this point, Martha could not say anything else.</p>  <p id = > Philip came forward and stood by the hospital bed under Martha’s scrutinizing gaze.</p>  <p id = > “Mom, you guys head out first. I have something I want to tell Philip,” Wynn said weakly.</p>  <p id = > Martha did not want to agree, but looking at the expression on Wynn’s face, she had no choice and could only relent.</p>  <p id = > Before leaving, she gave Philip a fierce stare while saying in a warning tone, “You’d better mention it to Wynn yourself. Otherwise, don’t blame me, your mother-in-law, for not keeping things civil with you.”</p>  <p id = > With that, the group left.</p>  <p id = > Only Philip and Wynn were left in the ward.</p>  <p id = > Philip sat nervously at the edge of the bed. He hesitated, not knowing how to begin.</p>  <p id = > Wynn glanced out the window into the night. It was a while before she spoke weakly, “Philip, I’m sorry. You know how my parents’ tempers are. I hope you won’t blame them.”</p>  <p id = > Philip nodded his head and chuckled before he said, “Wynn, don’t say that. They’re my parents as well. Of course, I won’t blame them.”</p>  <p id = > Glistening tears fell from the corners of Wynn’s eyes. She sniffled and wiped her tears silently, looking as if she had made a big decision.</p>  <p id = > Everything that happened tonight was unforgettable for Wynn.</p>  <p id = > Philip had changed. He became someone she could not see through.</p>  <p id = > She turned her head, her eyes red as she looked at the bewildered Philip. She said, “Philip, let’s get a divorce.”</p>           <h2 id =chapter-88 > Chapter 88</h2> <p id = > A divorce?</p>  <p id = > The way Wynn uttered those words… She seemed so calm.</p>  <p id = > Philip’s heart thudded. Silently, he rested his hands on his knees. He could not stop them from shaking slightly.</p>  <p id = > At that moment, he could only feel a buzzing in his brain. The word ‘divorce’ would not stop repeating in his ears.</p>  <p id = > He forgot to breathe, and he forgot to respond.</p>  <p id = > Wynn was too disappointed in him.</p>  <p id = > “Philip, I really can’t hold on any longer. I don’t want to go on like this. I don’t want to live in constant fear, worrying about the next day every single day, worrying about Mila’s condition every day. I gave you a year, and you said you would give me an answer. Yet, you have let me down so much now.”</p>  <p id = > Wynn cried out helplessly, tears dripping from her eyes.</p>  <p id = > The Philip she once loved deeply had become deplorable and dispirited.</p>  <p id = > He had become repulsive, disgusting, and despicable to her.</p>  <p id = > Philip raised his gaze, his eyes red as he asked, “Wynn, can you forgive me this time? I’ll change, I’ll try my best.”</p>  <p id = > Philip did not want to lose Wynn.</p>  <p id = > He would always place Wynn and Mila first in his heart.</p>  <p id = > “Trust me, I will definitely give you a future, a future that everyone will be jealous of.” Philip’s tone was sincere.</p>  <p id = > However, Wynn laughed as she turned her face to him. She looked like a weeping beauty as she asked, “A future? Philip, don’t you think you’ve said this many times already? But where is the future? You’re always lying to yourself, always unwilling to get off your high horse. How many times have I begged you? I told you to apologize to my parents, but what did you do? For the sake of your pathetic pride, you’ve never listened to me. Now you’re talking about a future to me? What’s that? The 100 BMW motorcycles? Or the Arc de Triumph Hotel?</p>  <p id = > Wynn had always saved her last ounce of patience for Philip. However, what Philip did tonight caused her to lose her patience.</p>  <p id = > It was just too ridiculous!</p>  <p id = > Even if Philip was in wretched poverty and delivered food for a living, Wynn did not think it was a big deal.</p>  <p id = > However, tonight, to satisfy his urge for performance and his weak ego, Philip actually did something like that.</p>  <p id = > Embarrassing!</p>  <p id = > It was too embarrassing.</p>  <p id = > How else would he lie to himself?</p>  <p id = > Naturally, Wynn no longer believed what Philip had told her at Arc de Triumph Hotel.</p>  <p id = > Philip hastily defended himself. “Wynn, believe me! When the time comes, you will understand.”</p>  <p id = > “Philip, that’s enough!” Wynn shouted. She became overwhelmed with her emotions and pulled on the wound on her abdomen. Cold sweat pooled on her forehead from the pain. “Get out of here, I don’t want to see you right now!”</p>  <p id = > She pointed angrily to the ward door, determination flashing through her eyes.</p>  <p id = > Philip had no choice. He was worried that Wynn’s emotions would affect her body.</p>  <p id = > Giving up, he stood up and said, “Alright, I’ll get out first, but I don’t agree to the divorce.”</p>  <p id = > With that, Philip got up and walked out of the ward unhesitatingly.</p>  <p id = > As soon as he left the ward, he saw his mother-in-law and several others sitting outside the door.</p>  <p id = > Seeing him, Martha stepped forward and asked coldly, “What did you say to my daughter? Did you mention the divorce? I’m telling you, the Johnston family does not want Mila as well. You take that red-headed stepchild with you.”</p>  <p id = > Martha was furious. She would like nothing more than for Philip to divorce her daughter immediately and get out of the Johnston family.</p>  <p id = > She had even funded them for their bridal suite.</p>  <p id = > If there was no other choice, she would drive away Philip and that embarrassing scoundrel together!</p>  <p id = > Seeing how Philip did not say anything, Martha then guessed what was going on. She pointed out with dissatisfaction, “You didn’t ask for a divorce, did you? Philip Clarke, let me tell you, in this household, it is I, Martha Yates, who makes the decisions. You and Wynn must get a divorce! I don’t care if you don’t agree. I’ll take you to the Civil Affairs Bureau in a few days to go through the formalities!”</p>  <p id = > Faced with Martha’s unreasonable orders, Philip could no longer contain his emotions. With a chilling expression on his face, he shouted, “Enough! Let me tell you, I will not divorce Wynn!”</p>  <p id = > With that, he left with a foul expression on his face.</p>  <p id = > Martha was furious!</p> <p id = > That loser actually yelled at her just now! Such disrespectful behavior toward his mother-in-law.</p>   <h2 id =chapter-89 > Chapter 89</h2> <p id = > Well, you’re a tough guy now, huh? You even dare to yell at me now? Philip Clarke, don’t you even think about entering my house ever again! There will be no door open for you!”</p>  <p id = > Martha had her hand on her waist as she shouted, pointing at Philip’s departing figure.</p>  <p id = > “What are you doing? This is a hospital, shouting is not allowed!” A nurse walked over with a cold expression on her face and reprimanded them.</p>  <p id = > Startled and angry, Martha tugged unreasonably onto Charles as she sobbed, “Charlie, you saw what happened. Philip is so unreasonable now. He even dares to shout at me now. From now on, in this family, he and I will not coexist.”</p>  <p id = > Martha was simply furious. Since when did a loser dare come up to her and talk to her in that manner?</p>  <p id = > “Alright, alright. Why don’t you stop saying so much as well. Do we have to add to this problem?” Charles said helplessly.</p>  <p id = > After decades, it was natural that he understood Martha’s temperament.</p>  <p id = > Philip was way too rude!</p>  <p id = > No matter the circumstances, she was still his mother-in-law. How could he yell at her directly in her face?</p>  <p id = > However, Charles also felt slightly surprised. It seemed that his son-in-law had become slightly different.</p>  <p id = > “Don’t you think that Charles is a little different today?” Charles asked.</p>  <p id = > “What’s the difference, he’s still a loser!” Martha replied indignantly.</p>  <p id = > Lynn and her parents watched in on the fun with a sneer on their faces.</p>  <p id = > Their opinion toward Philip, their niece’s husband, was that he was just a joke. It was pretty fun to curse about him once in a while.</p>  <p id = > Lynn felt very happy today. Seeing her wimpy cousin-in-law get all sorts of recriminations made her feel relaxed.</p>  <p id = > She did not stop live-streaming about Philip in the group chat. The entire matter was a big deal now.</p>  <p id = > There were even a few people who compiled the videos of Philip getting scolded into a mashup and posted them onto the Internet. That made Philip viral.</p>  <p id = > As such, Philip got the title of being the worst son-in-law in Riverdale.</p>  <p id = > Juan walked over after he paid for the hospital bills.</p>  <p id = > He had been watching from the corner with a pitiful gaze.</p>  <p id = > He felt a great deal of pleasure watching Philip get scolded.</p>  <p id = > That loser would never get any respect from the two elders.</p>  <p id = > “Uncle, Aunty, I’ve already paid the fees. I’ll take care of Wynn these few days. It’s already very late, why don’t you go home first? I’ll be here to take care of things.” Juan behaved graciously with a smile on his face. It made people feel closer to him.</p>  <p id = > Martha hurriedly took Juan’s hand in hers. Smiling from ear to ear, she said, “Juan, how could we trouble you like this? How much was it? I’ll bring you the money tomorrow.”</p>  <p id = > The child was thoughtful, and he was easy on the eyes as well.</p>  <p id = > Her daughter was still pretty attractive, seeing how she managed to attract so many boys to circle her.</p>  <p id = > She honestly had no idea why her daughter insisted on getting married to that little brat Philip. To add on, they even got pregnant before getting married, disgracing the Johnston family and causing her to look bad in her maiden home.</p>  <p id = > It could not be helped. Martha’s maiden family was a large family with strong traditional values.</p>  <p id = > When her daughter got pregnant out of wedlock, she was met with all kinds of spite and scorn from her family members back home.</p>  <p id = > This caused Martha to feel so embarrassed that she could not even raise her head in front of her family members.</p>  <p id = > For the past few years, Martha had not dared to return to her maiden family home, mainly because she was afraid of being shamed.</p>  <p id = > Not this time, however. She had to go back to celebrate her father’s 70th birthday.</p>  <p id = > It was because of this that Martha had been very grumpy recently. Seeing Philip’s dispirited face just made matters worse.</p>  <p id = > Juan waved his hand hurriedly as he said politely, “Aunty, please let me do something for Wynn.”</p>  <p id = > Martha did not continue insisting. Holding Juan’s hand in hers, she found herself liking him more and more.</p>  <p id = > For the next two or three days, Juan would come to visit Wynn every day.</p>  <p id = > Naturally, Philip would come as well.</p>  <p id = > However, when Juan came, he would be greeted warmly by Martha.</p>  <p id = > When Philip came, Martha would have a foul expression on her face. She looked as if she had a deep resentment toward him.</p>  <p id = > Besides, Martha would always find an opportunity to say something nasty about Philip. The things she said were always horrible. She would criticize him from head to toe.</p>  <p id = > Yet, Philip never said anything.</p>  <p id = > It was because he knew that Martha was angry with him. As such, he let her vent.</p>  <p id = > On that same day, Philip had just arrived at the hospital with a lunch box in hand when he received a call from Henry Turner.</p>  <p id = > “Hello, Mr. Clarke. We’ve studied Mila’s condition and have come up with a surgical plan. Shall I come over to discuss it with you?” Henry sounded very respectful over the phone.</p>  <p id = > If outsiders knew that Professor Henry Turner, the medical titan of China’s cardiology department, actually treated a man like him with such respect, a huge uproar would definitely be caused.</p>  <p id = > “Alright, I’m at Riverdale Public Hospital,” Philip replied.</p>  <p id = > After hanging up the phone, Philip walked into Wynn’s ward with the lunch box.</p>  <p id = > In the ward, Juan was sitting by Wynn’s bedside, talking to her.</p>  <p id = > “Wynn, there’s progress with Mila’s condition. I got my dad to contact the best doctor in China, Professor Henry Turner. He said he happens to be in Riverdale these few days and should be free to stop by today.”</p>  <p id = > Juan was very excited. This was something that he had asked for from his father for a long time.</p>          <h2 id =chapter-90 > Chapter 90</h2> <p id = > Philip walked in and placed the lunch box on the table. Then, he picked up an apple and began peeling it while listening to Juan and Wynn’s conversation in silence.</p>  <p id = > Juan and Wynn pretended that they did not see Philip, treating him like he was thin air.</p>  <p id = > “Are you sure, Brother Juan? It’s Professor… Professor Henry Turner?” Wynn appeared to be unusually excited, her eyes sparkling like stars and her gaze burning.</p>  <p id = > She knew about Henry Turner. He was regarded as the top cardiologist internationally with the title of being a medical titan.</p>  <p id = > Back when Mila first got diagnosed, Wynn had looked up all relevant information.</p>  <p id = > It could be said that Professor Henry Turner was the sage of the medical profession.</p>  <p id = > If they really could get him to treat Mila, then her illness would be 100% curable.</p>  <p id = > However, the catch was that they would have to manage to hire him.</p>  <p id = > Not anyone could meet with a medical titan.</p>  <p id = > Wynn knew profoundly how much energy and how many connections must have been used to get Professor Henry Turner to take a look at Mila’s condition.</p>  <p id = > Wynn would not be able to return this favor.</p>  <p id = > The corners of Juan’s lips curled into a smile as he said generously, “Don’t worry Wynn, I’ve always thought of Mila as my daughter. Her business is my business. It just so happens that Professor Henry is in Riverdale for an inspection. You should know something about it, it’s at the Riverdale branch of Turner hospital. Your company should have been in contact with them before.</p>  <p id = > “Besides, my father has a personal relationship with Professor Turner. So don’t worry, I’ll help you make sure that everything about Mila’s surgery is seen to.”</p>  <p id = > Juan’s face was full of smiles, his expression sincere.</p>  <p id = > In front of Wynn, as long as it was something she liked, Juan would do his best to get it done.</p>  <p id = > However, he had only one goal, which was to get Wynn for himself.</p>  <p id = > Philip, who was witnessing the entire thing, felt very unhappy.</p>  <p id = > What did he mean by thinking of Mila as his daughter?</p>  <p id = > What right did he have to say that?</p>  <p id = > Naturally, Wynn was slightly embarrassed, but her feelings of gratitude overpowered her feelings of embarrassment as she said thankfully, “Brother Juan, thank you so much.”</p>  <p id = > While saying that, she shifted her gaze slightly sideways to look at Philip who was peeling apples at the side. She felt somewhat helpless and disappointed.</p>  <p id = > She could not believe that he, a father, was paying less attention to his daughter’s condition than an outsider.</p>  <p id = > Just at that moment.</p>  <p id = > Philip’s phone rang. After taking a glance at the caller ID, he turned to walk out of the room.</p>  <p id = > “Mr. Clarke, I’ll be reaching the hospital shortly. Where are you?” The sound of Henry Turner’s respectful tone came through the phone. He sounded exceptionally excited.</p>  <p id = > Philip knitted his brows together as he said, “I’m at ward 1302, but don’t come here. Wait for me at the rest area.”</p>  <p id = > For the sake of preventing unnecessary trouble, Philip decided to meet him in private.</p>  <p id = > “Okay, okay. I’ll be there in five minutes,” Henry said as he waited for Philip to hang up the phone first.</p>  <p id = > When he returned to the ward, Juan asked snarkily, “Philip, who were you talking to? If you’re too busy, you can go back first. After all, punctuality is very important when delivering food. I’ll take care of Wynn here.”</p>  <p id = > Juan was not treating himself as an outsider at all.</p>  <p id = > On the other hand, Philip had no standing at all in front of Juan.</p>  <p id = > Watching the scene unfold, Wynn’s lips fluttered as she wanted to open her mouth, but she held back.</p>  <p id = > What use was there in speaking up for him? He was still the same person.</p>  <p id = > However, something surprising happened.</p>  <p id = > Philip smiled as he said, “I got a doctor for Mila, so I was asking him some questions earlier. He’ll be coming over shortly to take a look.”</p>  <p id = > As soon as this was said, Wynn’s heart, which had been unflustered all this while, suddenly began fluttering. She raised her eyebrows as her sparkling eyes stared at Philip.</p>  <p id = > However...</p>  <p id = > Juan instantly sneered as he said to Philip, “You, getting a doctor for Mila? What kind of doctor can you get? Do you know what Mila’s condition is? Is it something that any doctor can treat?”</p>  <p id = > The glimmer in Wynn’s eyes faded after hearing Juan’s sharp reply.</p>  <p id = > That was true. What kind of doctor could Philip get to treat Mila’s illness?</p>  <p id = > Could they be any better than Professor Henry Turner?</p>  <p id = > Still, it was not a bad thing that he was concerned about Mila’s condition.</p>  <p id = > At the very least, there was still a soft spot for Philip in Wynn’s heart.</p>  <p id = > Philip pursed his lips as he said indifferently, “Why can’t I? Mila is my daughter. Is there anything wrong with me getting her a doctor?”</p>  <p id = > He was very upset with Juan’s attitude.</p>  <p id = > The man was acting as if Mila was his blood daughter.</p>  <p id = > “Alright, I’d like to see how awesome the doctor you found is.” Juan stepped forward and patted Philip on the shoulder. There was a provocative look in his eyes. “It just so happens that I have an appointment with Professor Turner as well. Why don’t we meet him together? Get the doctor that you found to join us as well, and we’ll get them both to come up with a treatment plan. We’ll choose the best plan to move forward with.”</p>  <p id = > All this talk about choosing the best was just another reason for Juan to humiliate Philip.</p>  <p id = > In his knowledge, Professor Henry Turner, whom his father had contacted through his connections, was a medical titan.</p>  <p id = > Was there anyone else in the world more powerful than him?</p>               <h2 id =chapter-91 > Chapter 91</h2> <p id = > The pheasant doctor that Philip hired would probably begin trembling from shock after seeing Henry Turner.</p>  <p id = > Therefore, it was obvious that Juan said this just to see Philip make a fool of himself.</p>  <p id = > It was simply out of his league to fight with Juan.</p>  <p id = > Philip’s brows knitted together. He had only said what he said because he did not want to be underestimated by Juan and misunderstood by Wynn.</p>  <p id = > However, Juan’s aggressiveness made Philip feel very uncomfortable.</p>  <p id = > Should he tell them?</p>  <p id = > Philip did not want to burst their bubble. Sighing, he said, “Forget it, as long as you’re happy.”</p>  <p id = > Philip did not want to upset anyone. After all, his mother-in-law had been very concerned about Juan lately.</p>  <p id = > If he provoked Martha, there would not be anything good in store for him.</p>  <p id = > Besides, he had gone to the doctor for his daughter.</p>  <p id = > For that matter, Philip did not feel the need to humiliate Juan.</p>  <p id = > However, this was the only exception.</p>  <p id = > “Haha, Philip, you’re a funny one,” Juan said as he laughed sarcastically. The more he looked at Philip, the more he felt that he was a loser. “To be honest, I’m really curious to see if the doctor you’ve found is competent. After all, this is a big deal. If some quack treats Mila and something goes wrong in the process, will you be able to take responsibility if something goes wrong?”</p>  <p id = > Philip wanted to kill him!</p>  <p id = > Juan’s words were so cruel that even Wynn’s heart thumped when he said them.</p>  <p id = > “Philip, thank you for getting Mila a doctor. However, I feel that she needs a more specialized doctor for her treatment. Let’s leave this matter in the hands of Brother Juan,” Wynn said coldly. She did not want her daughter to die on the operating table.</p>  <p id = > In Philip’s ears, her words sounded like great distrust toward him.</p>  <p id = > Philip felt that it did not matter. It was just that he would lose his dignity a little.</p>  <p id = > As long as it was Henry Turner who treated Mila, why did it matter who found him?</p>  <p id = > “Well, say thank you to Brother Juan. What are you waiting for?” Wynn’s delicate eyebrows furrowed in dissatisfaction toward Philip’s behavior.</p>  <p id = > Juan had helped them so much, yet he was still rooted to the spot like a log.</p>  <p id = > “Thank you,” Philip said.</p>  <p id = > As long as it was a request from Wynn, Philip would oblige.</p>  <p id = > A thank you would not deduct his stature.</p>  <p id = > Juan raised his chin proudly as he dusted off his suit. “You’re welcome.”</p>  <p id = > After staying for a while, Philip made an excuse to find his way to the hospital’s waiting area.</p>  <p id = > Henry Turner could be seen in his gray suit, waiting patiently along with his two apprentices.</p>  <p id = > The moment he saw Philip, Henry walked over respectfully and bowed as he said smilingly, “Mr. Clarke.”</p>  <p id = > His two apprentices, who were standing behind him, were shocked.</p>  <p id = > Their teacher was an internationally renowned medical professor with a great number of disciples. He had saved at least several hundred, if not several thousand, lives.</p>  <p id = > It was surprising that a teacher so highly respected by everyone and a medical titan decorated with honors would behave so respectfully toward a young man who was dressed ordinarily.</p>  <p id = > Who was he?</p>  <p id = > What right did he have?</p>  <p id = > Philip inclined his head slightly as he said calmly, “Time is short. Why don’t we get right into it.”</p>  <p id = > Henry immediately had one of his apprentices hand over the proposal as he personally explained it to Philip.</p>  <p id = > Finally, Philip nodded his head in approval as he asked, “When will the surgery be done?”</p>  <p id = > “In a week,” Henry said. “In the meantime, we will conduct a thorough examination of Miss Clarke and nurse her health.</p>  <p id = > Philip hummed in response as he said, “Thank you for your trouble, Professor Turner.”</p>  <p id = > Henry panicked as he said hurriedly, “Mr. Clarke, don’t you worry. This operation will definitely be successful.”</p>  <p id = > As the conversation came to an end, Philip readied himself to leave. He had a plan.</p>  <p id = > Coincidentally, just as he had gotten ready to leave, someone shouted excitedly behind him. “Professor Turner! I didn’t expect to see you here. It’s so good to see you.”</p>  <p id = > Juan was just going to contact his father and have him give Professor Turner a call to inquire when he would be free so that he could pay him a visit in person.</p>  <p id = > Who would have thought that he would run into Professor Turner at the hospital!</p>  <p id = > Juan was very excited as he went forth and shook Professor Turner’s hand. He got straight to the point as he introduced himself, “How do you do, Professor Turner? I am Juan Parker, the son of Robert Parker.”</p>  <p id = > As he spoke, Juan’s eyes drifted to the side. When he saw Philip, who was standing not far away from Henry’s side, his expression changed into one of distaste. He said in surprise, “What are you doing here?”</p>      <h2 id =chapter-92 > Chapter 92</h2> <p id = > What was Philip doing here?</p>  <p id = > Not only that, he was standing beside Professor Henry Turner.</p>  <p id = > What was going on?</p>  <p id = > Juan was confused. Was it possible that Philip and Juan knew each other?</p>  <p id = > That was impossible! How would a reputable medical guru like Professor Turner know a wimp like Philip?</p>  <p id = > Professor Henry Turner was startled. He did not know Juan Parker, but he did know his father.</p>  <p id = > To be honest, they did not even really know each other. They simply had a few connections in common.</p>  <p id = > It was because he liked jade and had bought quite a few jade pieces to display in his house.</p>  <p id = > Once, when he was at Golden City, Henry received a beautiful piece of jade from Robert. It was an extremely rare piece made from green dragon jade, thus Henry remembered this favor.</p>  <p id = > Just a few days ago, Robert had contacted him personally. He said something about his son’s friend’s daughter suffering from congenital heart disease and begged him to take a look at her condition.</p>  <p id = > Did they think that any person could just persuade Henry Turner to do something?</p>  <p id = > Only after numerous pleas and taking into consideration that beautiful piece of jade did Henry agree to stop by and take a look.</p>  <p id = > “Do you know each other?” Henry asked as he stared at Juan.</p>  <p id = > That was because he could tell that Juan’s attitude toward Mr. Clarke was not the greatest. Could it be that they have a grudge between themselves?</p>  <p id = > As a result, Henry’s expression on his face gradually grew cooler as his brows knitted together.</p>  <p id = > If that was the case, then he would not help Juan in what he had asked for.</p>  <p id = > Juan snorted in response as he sneered. “Of course we know each other, Professor Turner. To be honest, it’s insulting for you to stand next to someone like that. Why don’t we go over there to talk? I’ll host a banquet in honor of you at Arc de Triumph tonight.”</p>  <p id = > Juan knew in his heart that someone like Philip would not know Professor Turner.</p>  <p id = > At most, he was just passing by.</p>  <p id = > Was it possible that the doctor he found was Henry Turner?</p>  <p id = > Did he have that much honor for that?</p>  <p id = > However, Henry’s expression immediately soured as he scoffed inwardly.</p>  <p id = > Insulting?</p>  <p id = > It was his good fortune to be able to stand next to Mr. Clarke!</p>  <p id = > Juan Parker was such a narrow-minded person!</p>  <p id = > “No, thank you! I don’t think Mr. Parker is qualified to dine with me yet.” Henry had a chilly expression on his face as he gazed sharply at Juan.</p>  <p id = > It was just a simple expression, yet it scared Juan to the core.</p>  <p id = > ‘You are not qualified’, these four words sounded especially harsh to Juan’s ears.</p>  <p id = > However, he did not dare to show his resentment. Instead, he asked in a panic, “Professor Turner, did I do something wrong? Please tell me, I promise I’ll change!”</p>  <p id = > Juan was panicking. If he had offended Professor Turner due to a small mistake on his part, not only would Wynn’s daughter not be able to receive treatment, but his family’s business would more or less be affected as well.</p>  <p id = > He really could not understand. It was only his first time meeting Professor Turner.</p>  <p id = > They had not exchanged more than five sentences.</p>  <p id = > How did he get into this medical guru’s bad books?</p>  <p id = > In a short while, Juan’s forehead was coated with cold sweat.</p>  <p id = > “Because you don’t know how to respect people!” Henry reprimanded. As he turned his head to reveal Philip’s identity, he saw the latter shake his head.</p>  <p id = > Henry was startled but understood immediately. He turned back to Juan and said, “Even if this… gentleman is ordinary, you shouldn’t insult him in that manner. People should know how to respect each other.”</p>  <p id = > His tone was not loud, but it was firm.</p>  <p id = > Juan’s entire body shuddered as he listened. There was something just so compelling about Henry’s aura!</p>  <p id = > This was the kind of person who often dealt with the higher-ups. You could not offend them easily.</p>  <p id = > “Yes, yes, Professor Turner. You are right,” Juan said as he nodded his head hurriedly. At the same time, he eyed Philip through the corner of his eyes. He simply hated him right now!</p>  <p id = > That loser was to blame. He was standing in the way of everything!</p>  <p id = > If it were not for him, would he be reprimanded by Professor Turner?</p>  <p id = > He must find a chance to humiliate him.</p>  <p id = > “Why are you still standing there? Aren’t you going to apologize to this gentleman?” Henry said cooly.</p>  <p id = > Apologize?</p>  <p id = > Juan looked at Philip, a hint of gloom appearing in the corner of his eyes.</p>  <p id = > Juan was very reluctant to apologize to this loser.</p>  <p id = > However, he had no choice. If he offended Henry, there would not be anything good in store for him.</p>  <p id = > After thinking it through, Juan opened his mouth to say cooly, “I’m sorry, Philip. I hope you don’t take to heart what I just said.”</p>  <p id = > Philip did not want to pick a fight. He nodded his head as he turned and prepared to leave.</p>  <p id = > However, something unexpected happened!</p>  <p id = > Martha came over hurriedly.</p>  <p id = > “Juan, why did you call me to come over so early in the morning?” When Martha looked at Juan, she was full of smiles. Her eyes were filled with fondness as if she was looking at her son-in-law.</p>  <p id = > However, when her gaze fell on Philip, she looked as if she had been pricked all over her body. She cried out in disgust, “Why are you here? Didn’t I tell you not to come anymore? Go, get out of this place!”</p>  <p id = > Martha got angry whenever she saw Philip.</p>  <p id = > This loser was so annoying no matter where he stood.</p>    <h2 id =chapter-93 > Chapter 93</h2> <p id = > Philip did not say anything. Instead, he laughed in resignation as he turned around to leave.</p>  <p id = > Martha was still muttering to herself. “What a sight for sore eyes.”</p>  <p id = > Henry’s brows furrowed. Was this Mr. Clarke’s mother-in-law?</p>  <p id = > She was so spirited and rude.</p>  <p id = > Mr. Clarke was really unlucky to have such a mother-in-law.</p>  <p id = > “Wait!”</p>  <p id = > Henry called out to Philip and stood in front of him.</p>  <p id = > He was not happy with the way this mother-in-law was acting. Thus, he wanted to do something for Mr. Clarke.</p>  <p id = > “Who is this?” Henry’s tone was cold as he spoke to Juan.</p>  <p id = > Juan immediately responded in a complimentary manner, “Professor Turner, this is…”</p>  <p id = > Before the introductions could be finished, Martha began scolding unreasonably, “Who are you, you old grouch! What, do you want to speak up for that wimp?”</p>  <p id = > Old grouch?</p>  <p id = > Everyone present was dumbfounded!</p>  <p id = > This was the first time that Henry had been scolded in such a manner in his many years of practicing medicine.</p>  <p id = > At that moment, he was so angry that all his blood rushed toward his head.</p>  <p id = > His apprentices, who were standing beside him, felt the same way. They stared coldly, itching to rip off the woman’s mouth.</p>  <p id = > Juan was even more shocked. He tugged viciously on Martha’s arm. “Aunty Martha, don’t be rude. He is…”</p>  <p id = > “I don’t care! Those who can speak up for that useless fool Philip can’t be any better off! Look at you, you’re already so old yet still dressed so flamboyantly! What, are you trying to lure little girls? You have no respect for your old age!”</p>  <p id = > Martha was the kind who would not hold back when scolding someone. Her words were so poisonous.</p>  <p id = > “Say something, you old man! Why aren’t you speaking anymore? You were pretty fierce just now. Why don’t you dare to say anything now? Did I blow your cover? Shameless old thing! Bah!” Martha tucked her arms into her chest arrogantly as she raised her eyebrows.</p>  <p id = > Her choice of words was as poisonous as a fishwife shouting abuse in the street, cursing Henry to the very core.</p>  <p id = > In her eyes, there was nothing to fear.</p>  <p id = > The entire group was stunned.</p>  <p id = > Juan was so frightened that he had begun shaking.</p>  <p id = > On one side was Wynn’s mother, and on the other hand, was a medical titan.</p>  <p id = > “Aunty Martha! Do you know who that is?” Juan had become anxious. He pulled Martha to the side as he explained. “That’s Henry Turner!”</p>  <p id = > “Henry who? I don’t care who he is. I don’t know him.” Martha waved her hand, acting like an ignorant village woman.</p>  <p id = > “Aunty Martha! You’re in deep trouble now. Professor Henry Turner is an internationally recognized doctor and a legend within the country’s medical community! He’s the honorary guest of Hank Moseby, Jace Wade, and Hector Lee! Even the higher-ups in the county are his patients!”</p>  <p id = > Juan was frantic. She had practically dug her own grave!</p>  <p id = > If they offended this person, they would have to behead themselves ten times before they could be excused!</p>  <p id = > “Huh?”</p>  <p id = > When Martha heard what Juan said, she was so frightened that she nearly lost her footing!</p>  <p id = > “This… This… This old man is so powerful?” Martha threw a frightened gaze at Henry who was standing nearby with a stony gaze on his face. As her eyes came into contact with his icy stare, she shuddered.</p>  <p id = > “He knows all the tycoons in Orienta, and the higher-ups in the county are his patients.”</p>  <p id = > Martha nearly fainted from shock.</p>  <p id = > She was used to being arrogant and domineering. Now, in the presence of someone so powerful, Martha did not even dare to breathe loudly. She was so anxious.</p>  <p id = > After he had spoken to Martha, Juan hurriedly made his way back to Professor Henry. He bowed as he apologized profusely. “Professor Turner, I’m sorry. Aunty Martha hasn’t heard of you and offended you. I apologize on her behalf.”</p>  <p id = > Hmmph!</p>  <p id = > Henry Turner was not an easy person to talk to. He huffed coldly, his gaze chilly.</p>  <p id = > At this point, Martha realized that she should say something. She hurriedly made her way over.</p>  <p id = > Walking forth with an apologetic smile on her face, she made her apologies, “Well, Professor Turner, I’m so sorry. I didn’t know who you were. I’ll make my apologies here, I’m sorry.”</p>  <p id = > Martha was trembling. Although she was usually an arrogant and domineering person, she would only act that way in front of Philp. When she met big shots like Henry, she would also act meekly.</p>  <p id = > “Is an apology enough? Didn’t you say I’m an old fool and have no respect for my age?!”</p>  <p id = > Henry’s gaze was cold and piercing. Just a simple gaze could give one the urge to kneel. “If I don’t teach you a lesson today, I, Henry Turner, will no longer be a doctor!”</p>  <p id = > The group present was afraid to even breathe!</p>  <p id = > If Henry were to become infuriated, the entire Riverdale would be shocked!</p>  <p id = > Martha felt nothing but desperation at that moment. With a pale face, she very nearly got on her knees!</p>  <p id = > There was cold sweat all over Juan’s head. He was already thinking of ways to solve this misunderstanding.</p>  <p id = > “Mr. Turner, for my sake, please let this matter go.”</p>  <p id = > Just at that moment, a voice that sounded so plain yet seemed so out of place rang out.</p>            <h2 id =chapter-94 > Chapter 94</h2> <p id = > A simple sentence, yet Martha’s and Juan’s hearts thudded at the sound of it!</p>  <p id = > What did he mean by ‘for his sake’?</p>  <p id = > How could that useless bum say something like that at a time like this!</p>  <p id = > Was his honor that precious?</p>  <p id = > Martha was trembling with anger. Philip was a big talker and knew just when to pick his moment.</p>  <p id = > Was he deliberately trying to embarrass himself and offend Henry?</p>  <p id = > Was it revenge?</p>  <p id = > “Philip, shut up! Who do you think you are? Do you think you have a say in this matter?” Martha admonished with trepidation.</p>  <p id = > She was really worried that Philip, that piece of trash, would accidentally offend someone as important as Henry Turner.</p>  <p id = > He even asked him to let the matter go for his sake. Did he not know how much more noble this man was when compared to him?</p>  <p id = > Philip’s brows knitted together. He had not thought that Martha would be the first to reprimand him.</p>  <p id = > He was trying to get her out of trouble through his kind intentions, but instead, she retaliated.</p>  <p id = > “Why are you still standing there? Aren’t you going to apologize to Professor Turner?” Martha had finally found her chance. She did not waste any energy in criticizing Philip, hoping that Professor Turner would not pay attention to her.</p>  <p id = > The same thing happened with Juan. His gaze grew chilly as the corners of his lips twitched slightly. He felt very displeased.</p>  <p id = > He could not believe Philip. How could he speak so sarcastically at this time!</p>  <p id = > If they offended Professor Turner, they would all be in deep trouble.</p>  <p id = > Thus, he immediately stepped forward and chastised, “Philip, apologize immediately to Professor Turner. What do you mean for your sake? Is your honor that precious? How dare you say such things!”</p>  <p id = > “That’s right, even if you want to die, don’t drag us along with you,” Martha immediately chimed in, a b*tchy smile appearing on her face. “Professor Turner, as you can see, it was Philip who disrespected you. If you want trouble, go after him, not me. I’ve already apologized to you. Surely you won’t hold a grudge against a woman like me.”</p>  <p id = > Martha was flaunting her vulnerability as a woman.</p>  <p id = > The two echoed off each other as they spoke. In no time, Martha and Juan had criticized every part of Philip.</p>  <p id = > “Professor Turner, Philip is just a clueless person. Please don’t stoop down to his level,” Juan said with a complimentary smile on his face before he turned to snap at Philip. “What are you waiting for? Aren’t you going to apologize to Professor Turner? Do you know what he’s here for?”</p>  <p id = > He was the best cardiologist in the country that Juan had hired at a great expense!</p>  <p id = > A medical titan!</p>  <p id = > He was here for Philip's daughter!</p>  <p id = > How dare he show such disrespect!</p>  <p id = > He would have to make sure he told Wynn about this. She would definitely have a bigger problem with Philip after this.</p>  <p id = > Thinking of this, Juan snickered to himself.</p>  <p id = > However...</p>  <p id = > A scene that amazed them occurred!</p>  <p id = > Henry’s eyes grew wide as he glared at Juan. He spoke coolly, “Mr. Parker, have you forgotten what I just told you? You should not judge a person lightly, let alone insult them! The way you speak makes me think that there is something greatly wrong with your character!”</p>  <p id = > Henry finally understood.</p>  <p id = > This strange mother-in-law and Juan Parker clearly despised Mr. Clarke.</p>  <p id = > They must be blind!</p>  <p id = > If Mr. Clarke’s true identity was made known to them, they would probably be on their knees begging for mercy.</p>  <p id = > Panicked, Juan hurriedly bowed in agreement. “Professor Turner, you’re right. I'm wrong here. However, Philip was disrespectful toward you. I could not stand by and do nothing, that’s why I criticized him.”</p>  <p id = > However...</p>  <p id = > Surprisingly...</p>  <p id = > Henry addressed Martha in front of everyone present. “Today, for the sake of this… Mr. Clarke, I won’t hold a grudge against you, you country bumpkin. However, don’t be too cocky. If I find out that you’re still giving Mr. Clarke a hard time, I’ll make you regret it!”</p>  <p id = > Martha did not dare to say anything. With a face full of smiles, she nodded her head repeatedly in agreement.</p>  <p id = > They remained this way for a short while.</p>  <p id = > Suddenly, Henry snapped. “Well, what are you waiting for? Aren’t you going to apologize to Mr. Clarke?”</p>  <p id = > Apologize to Philip?!</p>  <p id = > Juan did not dare to utter a word!</p>  <p id = > Martha was dumbfounded!</p>  <p id = > Her, the mother-in-law, was being asked to apologize to her good-for-nothing son-in-law?</p>  <p id = > Blasphemy!</p>  <p id = > Martha nearly went ballistic!</p>  <p id = > She was full of rage!</p>  <p id = > She was so narrow-minded, so how could she apologize to this useless bum?</p>  <p id = > Besides, he was her son-in-law!</p>  <p id = > After stammering for a good while, Martha gave Philip a deadly stare. She wished she could make a voodoo doll of him that she could poke to death!</p>  <p id = > Philip was startled as well. He had not thought that Henry would use his power this way.</p>  <p id = > Thus, he immediately shook his head and waved his hands. “No, no, no, Mr. Turner. I’m really fine.”</p>  <p id = > However, Henry refused to back down. With his expression still chilly, he stared at Martha as he said threateningly, “You can choose not to apologize. However, I would like to tell you that even the reputable people in Riverdale will address me respectfully as Professor Turner.”</p> <p id = > Slap!</p> <p id = > This was a virtual slap aimed toward Martha.</p>  <p id = > She was just a civilian woman, so how would she dare to go against someone as powerful as Henry?</p>  <p id = > Thus, although she was reluctant to do so, she had no choice but to say begrudgingly to Philip, “Sorry.”</p>  <p id = > Her attitude was not great, but at least she said it.</p>   <h2 id =chapter-95 > Chapter 95</h2> <p id = > Right at the moment she said it, Martha already had a hundred plans to seek revenge on Philip.</p>  <p id = > However, just as Juan was about to ask about the matter of visiting a doctor, Henry left.</p>  <p id = > Juan immediately panicked and rushed to catch up.</p>  <p id = > There was only Martha and Philip left in the rest area. The former was staring at Philip fiercely, her eyes filled with a flame of anger.</p>  <p id = > \"Mom, you didn't...\"</p>  <p id = > Slap!</p>  <p id = > Before Philip could finish speaking, Martha had slapped him across the cheek and cursed, \"How about it? Does it feel good to have me apologize to you?\"</p>  <p id = > ‘I would not be a Yates if I didn't beat you up!’</p>  <p id = > Philip was speechless. His cheek was aching with burning pain, and his fists were pinched tightly in his trousers.</p>  <p id = > \"Oh, are you unhappy about it? Come hit this old lady if you can. Come on, hit me.\" Martha immediately pushed Philip with a challenging look.</p>  <p id = > More people had come to look.</p>  <p id = > Then, Martha gave up. Before she left, she glared at Philip fiercely. She scolded, \"Useless! Die early and quickly reincarnate! Bring your bastard child along and go together!\"</p>  <p id = > Bastard child?</p>  <p id = > She called  Mila a bastard child!</p>  <p id = > Mila was the flesh and blood of her own daughter. Mila was her granddaughter!</p>  <p id = > When Martha had cursed him in the past, Philip would just endure it. Today, it was obvious that Martha crossed the line!</p>  <p id = > \"Martha Yates! I’m warning you, you can curse me, but do not curse Mila! She is your granddaughter!\"</p>  <p id = > Philip glared at Martha with his eyes red as he scolded. He was furious and did not hold himself back.</p>  <p id = > At that moment, Martha’s first reaction was fear. She did not expect Philip, who had always been wimpy, to actually throw a tantrum at her!</p>  <p id = > Was he thinking of going against the sky?!</p>  <p id = > How dare he yell at her! The last time as well.</p>  <p id = > \"Philip Clarke, what did you just call me? Very well, you dare to call me by my full name now. You sure are brave now, even getting angry with your own mother-in-law! Well, well, well… In this family, there can only be either me or you! Take your bastard child with you tomorrow and move out of the house I bought for all of you!\"</p>  <p id = > Martha was extremely mad, and she immediately cursed like a shrew.</p>  <p id = > However, Philip said, \"Mom, that house was not bought by you alone. You have no right to drive us away. Also, if you really drive me out, you might regret it very much.\"</p>  <p id = > \"Tsk!\" Martha smirked contemptuously and said, \"Why would I regret throwing a piece of trash like you out? The thing I regret most now is letting Wynnie marry you!\"</p>  <p id = > In the middle of Martha's continuous scoldings, Philip had turned and left.</p>  <p id = > \"Where do you think you’re going? We haven't made clear the matter just now...\"</p>  <p id = > Philip went back to the ward and took out the porridge he made. He wanted to feed it to Wynn at first, but she declined immediately and proceeded to sip the porridge from a bowl herself.</p>  <p id = > Not long later, Juan came in and said, \"Wynn, I'm really sorry. Something went wrong on Professor Turner's side, so I am heading over now. Don't worry, I will definitely handle Mila’s matters properly.\"</p>  <p id = > Afterward, Juan left the scene hurriedly.</p>  <p id = > Although Wynn did not know what had happened, she knew that it was definitely something urgent. She said a few words like asking Juan to not push himself too much.</p>  <p id = > Philip had not spoken since the start. He tidied up the dishes and brought them out to wash.</p> <p id = > As Wynn was leaning on the hospital bed, she looked out of the window and thought of a person in her mind—someone who was possibly able to help her.</p>  <p id = > It was Mrs. Clarke.</p>  <p id = > As she was thinking about it, Wynn took out her mobile phone and found Mrs. Clarke’s contact number. After a long hesitation, she prepared her emotions and dialed the number.</p>  <p id = > Come to think of it, as a woman, Mrs. Clarke would probably help her out.</p>  <p id = > \"Passing by your entire world, I have lived the fullest for myself. Please go forward and don't look back. I will be the one waiting for you at the end.\"</p>  <p id = > It was a familiar ringtone. However, at the same moment when the ringtone rang in the receiver, the ringing of another phone also sounded from the ward.</p>  <p id = > \"Daddy, daddy, where are we going,</p> <p id = > There is no need to fear as long as I am here,</p> <p id = > Baby, baby, I am your big tree,</p> <p id = > I will watch the sunrise with you for the rest of my life...\"</p>  <p id = > Too familiar!</p>  <p id = > It was because the song was sung by Philip, Wynn, and Mila. It was recorded as a ringtone for incoming calls.</p>  <p id = > Wynn was surprised. She slowly moved the phone away from her ear while looking for the ringing phone in the ward. In the end, her gaze was fixed on Philip's jacket which he had taken off when he entered the ward just now.</p>  <p id = > Wynn glanced at the number she dialed in her hand. She had indeed called Mrs. Clarke, not Philip.</p>  <p id = > Was this just a coincidence?</p>    <h2 id =chapter-96 > Chapter 96</h2> <p id = > Wynn stepped down from the bed and walked toward Philip's black jacket.</p>  <p id = > The ringing continued to sound in the ward.</p>  <p id = > Just as Wynn picked up the jacket and was about to take the phone out, Philip suddenly walked in and snatched the jacket from her hand. Then, he smiled calmly. \"I'm going out to answer the call.\"</p>  <p id = > After saying this, Philip turned away and walked out of the ward.</p>  <p id = > He took out the phone and had a look at it. It was Wynn's number!</p>  <p id = > He could only hang up.</p>  <p id = > That was too dangerous!</p>  <p id = > At that moment just now, Philip felt like he had gone to another world. His forehead was covered with cold sweat.</p>  <p id = > It was still not a good time to tell Wynn about his identity.</p>  <p id = > It was not that he deliberately wanted to conceal it, but if Wynn came to know about it, she, Mila, and even the entire Johnston family would be in danger. Only Philip himself was aware of this danger.</p>  <p id = > Philip had seen that woman's tactics.</p>  <p id = > During the time when he left his family, that woman had more or less been pushing things around behind the scene.</p>  <p id = > In the ward, Wynn folded her arms while listening to the tone from the phone. Her brows furrowed. 'Could it be that she has something to do?'</p>  <p id = > She made another call but was informed once more that the receiver’s line was busy. Feeling helpless, Wynn could only give up with a sigh of relief. After all, it was still slightly difficult for her to beg others.</p>  <p id = > At this moment, Philip walked in and said, \"There is something urgent at the company. They need me to go back.\"</p>  <p id = > Wynn did not mind as she was feeling irritated and just nodded a few times in response.</p>  <p id = > Mila's surgery could not be delayed any longer.</p>  <p id = > Hope could not be placed on only Juan. If worse came to worst, Wynn could only rely on him.</p>  <p id = > However, before Philip left the ward, he said lightly, \"Wynnie, don't worry. I will arrange Mila's surgery. I have contacted a well-known doctor in the country and they have also given a treatment plan. In these next few days, it’ll...\"</p>  <p id = > \"Okay, I got it.\"</p>  <p id = > Wynn immediately interrupted Philip with a cold face. It was not that she did not believe Philip, she just wondered if the doctor he found was useful or not.</p>  <p id = > Philip was stunned, even looking a little uneasy.</p>  <p id = > Wynn seemed to have become aware of the issue with her attitude and explained in a slightly irritated tone, \"Philip, don't get me wrong. Thank you for your concern about Mila. I’m just… I’m just a little frustrated.\"</p>  <p id = > Philip naturally understood Wynn's current feelings.</p>  <p id = > \"I understand, Mila is also my daughter. If you have any ideas, you can discuss them with me.\" Philip smiled.</p>  <p id = > Wynn smiled back at him too. She nodded and said, \"Alright, isn't there something that your company needs you with? You should go and settle it.\"</p>  <p id = > Philip nodded. As soon as he turned to leave, Martha rushed in angrily.</p>  <p id = > Without saying anything else, she came up, pointed at Philip’s nose, and cursed, “Philip Clarke, how did you talk to me just now? Have your wings already hardened? Is that why you did not even put me, your mother-in-law, in your eyes?”</p>  <p id = > He was really going against the sky!</p>  <p id = > This piece of trash son-in-law also dared to yell at her now.</p>  <p id = > As a mother-in-law herself, had she not become so undignified?</p>  <p id = > He must be punished!</p>  <p id = > Philip also knew that he would not get good things from Martha if he offended her, so he could only bow his head and admit his mistake. \"Mom, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have treated you like...\"</p>  <p id = > \"What's the use of saying sorry now?\"</p>  <p id = > Martha was uncompromising and unforgiving. Her face was full of sarcasm and anger. \"Both of you should talk now about when you’ll be getting your divorce.”</p>  <p id = > Divorce.</p>  <p id = > Again, divorce.</p>  <p id = > Philip was really annoyed. His expression had changed slightly.</p>  <p id = > Wynn, who was at the side, walked over as well and gave a helpless sigh. She asked, \"Mom, what's wrong with you again? Causing trouble here early in the morning... Can’t you just let me have a quiet time?\"</p>  <p id = > Wynn knew her mother's temper quite well.</p>  <p id = > Causing trouble unreasonably as well as throwing tantrums childishly were her ultimate skills.</p>  <p id = > She had never truly treated Philip as her son-in-law.</p>  <p id = > Everything was because Wynn had a premarital pregnancy with Philip, causing her to be shamed by her family. It was because of this that Wynn and Philip moved out and bought a small apartment for themselves to stay.</p>  <p id = > On usual days, everyone just complied with Martha. Even if she was being unreasonable, everyone would just endure it.</p>  <p id = > \"What do you mean I am making trouble? Don’t you know? This trash dared to scold me outside just now!\"</p>  <p id = > Martha stretched out her hand and pointed at Philip's nose. \"I don't care what both of you think. In this family, he and I can’t coexist.\"</p>  <p id = > Wynn felt helpless. She gave Philip a look and pretended to scold him, \"Philip, how did you speak to my mother just now? What are you waiting for? Quickly apologize!\"</p>  <p id = > Philip did not know what to do, so he bent down and apologized, \"Mom, I'm sorry.\"</p>  <p id = > At this time, Martha was like a big, victorious rooster with her chin held high. She continued to scold a few more curses at him.</p>  <p id = > Philip also continued to apologize a few more times. Only then was he able to leave.</p>                 <h2 id =chapter-97 > Chapter 97</h2> <p id = > Seeing Philip walk away, she turned her head, took Wynn’s hand, and earnestly said, “Oh Wynnie, haven’t I told you? Why do you still want to be with that trash? Are there no good men in this world? I think Aiden isn’t bad. He’s handsome and has a good family background. What counts is that he treats your father and me well.”</p>  <p id = > Wynn felt very helpless. She knew her mother was up to nothing good when she came over.</p>  <p id = > “Mom, please stop talking. I don’t feel like thinking about this now.”</p>  <p id = > Wynn helplessly said. She went up to her bed and lied down sideways.</p>  <p id = > Martha, however, continued talking. “If you don’t like Aiden, Juan is okay too. I see that he’s busy these days. This type of guy is extremely rare now.”</p>  <p id = > When Wynn did not reply to her, Martha got so mad that she groaned.</p>  <p id = > “This girl! How are you so stubborn? What’s good about Philip Clarke? He can’t earn money and has no social connections. His friends are poorer than the others. This type of man is a scum of society.</p>  <p id = > “I don’t care if you agree or not, you’re my daughter. I call the shots for you. You must divorce Philip!”</p>  <p id = > Martha had secretly made up her mind that for her daughter’s marriage and also for her future happiness, she must take matters into her own hands.</p>  <p id = > Wynn was tired of listening. She ignored her mother and covered herself with the blanket.</p>  <p id = > Martha whispered a few words, carried her bag in a swift manner, and left the hospital.</p>  <p id = > Philip was ready to return to the company after leaving the hospital.</p>  <p id = > Mila was still at the company being taken care of. Things had been really busy these days and he could not take care of her.</p>  <p id = > While riding the electric scooter, Philip’s phone rang. It turned out that Lynn was the one calling.</p>  <p id = > Why was she calling him?</p>  <p id = > The call connected and Lynn’s cold shout came from the other side, “Philip, come to Starlight Bar! Hurry over in ten minutes! If you dare to be late, I’ll tell on you in front of Wynn!”</p>  <p id = > Snap!</p>  <p id = > The call ended after she finished speaking.</p>  <p id = > Philip had not figured out what was happening. He could only sigh helplessly and ride his scooter to Starlight Bar in a rush.</p>  <p id = > Only when he arrived did he find out that there were seven or eight young people surrounding Lynn and her four friends in the bar lobby.</p>  <p id = > There were two men and three women.</p>  <p id = > Philip was very familiar with the two men—Kyle Lyon and Jacob Wells.</p>  <p id = > Kyle and Jacob both had injuries on their faces. Their cheeks were red and swollen, and they had bruises at the corner of their eyes.</p>  <p id = > As soon as Philip arrived, Lynn got up and scolded arrogantly, “Half an hour has passed! Didn’t I say to arrive in ten minutes?!”</p>  <p id = > “Sorry, traffic.” Philip smiled.</p>  <p id = > “Traffic with that broken scooter? You did it on purpose, didn’t you? I’ll go back and tell my cousin that you frequent brothels!” Lynn said mercilessly.</p>  <p id = > Kyle and Jacob also sneered.</p>  <p id = > “Lynn, why did you call this good-for-nothing? What can he do?”</p>  <p id = > “That’s right, what can this idiot do?”</p>  <p id = > Philip frowned slightly, turned around, and walked away without saying a word.</p>  <p id = > He did not come here to be bullied!</p>  <p id = > At this moment, Lynn got anxious and shouted loudly, “Philip, if you dare leave, I definitely won’t let you go! As long as I say a few words to Uncle and Aunt, can you still have a good life with the Johnstons?”</p>  <p id = > Sure enough, once these words were spoken, Philip stopped. He turned around and stared darkly at Lynn.</p>  <p id = > “What do you want? I don’t have the time to accompany you kids doing mischief,” Philip said coolly.</p>  <p id = > At this moment, all seven or eight people there sneered.</p>  <p id = > One of them had red hair and a slanted fringe. They were wearing a floral shirt with an open neckline that revealed a tattoo. They were smoking and looking at Philip with squinted eyes. “This uncle has a big mouth. I heard Lynn say that you’re her cousin’s husband. So she’s your sister-in-law?”</p>  <p id = > Philip frowned. This person was rakish. He guessed that Lynn and the others must have provoked them.</p>  <p id = > At most, it was about money.</p>  <p id = > “What’s the matter? Just let them go. I have other things to do,” said Philip.</p>  <p id = > “F*ck! Watch how you talk to our Dick Jayson!”</p>  <p id = > “You kids are crazy! You wanna play?!”</p>  <p id = > “F*ck your mom! Apologize to Dick Jayson!”</p>  <p id = > All of a sudden, the few young people behind Dick angrily pointed at Philip and swore fiercely.</p>  <p id = > Lynn was also scared to death, so she stood up, pointed at Philip, and shouted, “Philip Clarke, you’re crazy! Why’re you talking to Dick Jayson? Quickly apologize to him!”</p>  <p id = > This Philip Clarke was usually a coward. Why was he so unyielding now?</p>  <p id = > If Dick was offended, they could not leave this place!</p>  <p id = > However, Dick smiled and allowed his subordinates to press Lynn back as he said to Philip, “100,000 bucks! Your sister-in-law owes us 100,000 bucks. As long as you bring out the money, you can take them away.”</p>  <p id = > 100,000 bucks?</p>  <p id = > Instantly, Philip looked at Lynn in surprise. The latter turned her head indifferently and with not an ounce of shame, she said, “Why are you still standing there? Hurry up and withdraw the money. I still have class in the afternoon.”</p>   <h2 id =chapter-98 > Chapter 98</h2> <p id = > Philip’s face darkened. He did not understand. How could Lynn, a university student, owe someone 100,000 bucks?!</p>  <p id = > “What happened?” Philip asked softly.</p>  <p id = > Lynn felt very uncomfortable when she saw the way Philip looked at her. Her whole body felt prickly. It was just like being scrutinized by a roadside beggar.</p>  <p id = > “Hurry up and withdraw the money. Do you still want to see me being held captive by them?” Lynn stared at Philip. He was still standing there dumbly like a blockhead.</p>  <p id = > Although Kyle and Jacob were scared of Dick Jayson, they were not scared of Philip. Since Philip was here, it must mean that this useless bum was afraid of Lynn. It was only natural to make him withdraw the money to save them.</p>  <p id = > “F*ck! What are you looking at! Quickly withdraw the money!” Kyle immediately slammed the table and stood up shouting.</p>  <p id = > In his eyes, Philip was an idiot.</p>  <p id = > However, in the next second, Philip looked at Dick Jayson coldly and said, “I don’t have money, but I must take her with me. As for the other two people, I don’t know them.”</p>  <p id = > Everyone was dumbfounded!</p>  <p id = > No one expected Philip to actually say such things in front of Dick Jayson!</p>  <p id = > Long before Philip came, several people got to know him through Lynn. Philip Clarke, this person, was a useless man. That was what they knew him as.</p>  <p id = > The reason why Lynn called Philip was that she could hold him down easily. He was an easy target who would withdraw the money and save her.</p>  <p id = > However, things were different now. Philip gave off an assertive feeling! While facing Dick Jayson of Starlight Bar, there was no fear in his expression at all.</p>  <p id = > At this moment, Lynn was scared and very angry. She got up and walked over. She slapped him and scolded, “Philip, that’s enough! Is that how you talk to Dick Jayson? If you don’t have money, then get out immediately. Don’t embarrass me here!”</p>  <p id = > However, Lynn’s slap did not land. Her fair wrist was squeezed by Philip mid-air.</p>  <p id = > “Lynn Johnston, if you still want to get out, just sit there obediently!” Philip’s face was dark, his eyes full of coldness.</p>  <p id = > Lynn was so frightened by him that her whole body shivered.  She had never felt this kind of vigor from Philip Clarke before.</p>  <p id = > Too cold!</p>  <p id = > How scary!</p>  <p id = > It was scarier than when she confronted Dick Jayson just now.</p>  <p id = > With a puff, Lynn was so frightened that her legs were weak. She immediately sat down and stared at Philip with a flustered look.</p>  <p id = > Was this really the brother-in-law that let others vilify him?</p>  <p id = > Kyle and Jacob also died down at this moment. They could only sit in the corner with their heads down pitifully as they whispered a few words.</p>  <p id = > After all, whether or not they could not get out depended on this good-for-nothing.</p>  <p id = > At this moment, Dick sneered and said, “Bro, if you have no money, just get out. Don’t get in the way, understand?”</p>  <p id = > Dick was very dissatisfied.</p>  <p id = > However, Dick Jayson was not someone who acted violently at every disagreement. Otherwise, he would not be guarding Starlight Bar.</p>  <p id = > “She is my sister-in-law. I also don’t wanna cause trouble. I’ll take her away and pretend this never happened. I’ll think of ways to pay back the money she owes you,” Philip said calmly.</p>  <p id = > 100,000 dollars was really nothing to him, but he had to take Lynn away now. Truth be told, he could have not cared about Lynn’s life or death. However, she was Wynn’s cousin after all. He would help if he could.</p>  <p id = > Seeing that the other party was silent, Philip glanced at Lynn and said, “Let’s go.”</p>  <p id = > Lynn hesitated for a moment. When she was about to get up, Dick’s thugs who were beside her held onto her shoulders.</p>  <p id = > Dick turned his head, looked at Philip coldly, and said, “Bro, don’t go looking for trouble. Since you have no money and capabilities, let your wife or her family members bring the money.”</p>  <p id = > With that, Dick snapped his fingers and his subordinate handed over an IOU. “This is the money Lynn Johnston borrowed from me three months ago that amounts to 60,000 dollars. Including interest, the total is 103,000 dollars. It’s not like I want this to be a matter of life and death. As long as you bring me the 100,000, you can take them away.”</p>  <p id = > After speaking, Dick leaned on the sofa and smoked a cigarette indifferently.</p>  <p id = > “I don’t have any money with me, but I can withdraw it for you later,” said Philip.</p>  <p id = > Dick lost his patience. He kicked the coffee table violently and said angrily, “What the f*ck are you doing here without money? To play?! Quickly let this piece of trash go!”</p>  <p id = > As soon as he finished speaking, two people said to Philip, “Brother Dick is letting you go. Can’t you hear?!”</p>  <p id = > Philip pointed at Lynn briefly and slowly said, “She has to come with me.”</p>  <p id = > “Quickly go!” These two people were already starting to lose their patience.</p>  <p id = > This idiot was really f*cking stubborn. Did he not understand what Brother Dick said?</p>  <p id = > Did he need to get his head smashed to know where he was standing?</p>  <p id = > However...</p>  <p id = > Philip very calmly looked at Dick and said, “I’ll pay back the money she owes, but you have to let her go.”</p>  <p id = > “Me too, me too.”</p>  <p id = > “Us too, Uncle.”</p>  <p id = > Lynn’s friends, as though they had seen hope at this moment, busily interrupted.</p>  <p id = > Dick raised his eyebrows, his expression unhappy as he looked at Philip.</p>  <p id = > Was he looking to die?</p>           <h2 id =chapter-99 > Chapter 99</h2> <p id = > \"Bro, you are so f*cking amusing. No one has ever dared to talk to me like this. You are the first one.\" Dick lit another cigarette. Taking in a deep breath, he said slowly.</p>  <p id = > As he was saying this, two of his men closed the door of the bar.</p>  <p id = > As it was daytime, the bar was closed.</p>  <p id = > Philip raised his brows. He glanced at the surrounding people. They were all geared up and ready to fight. All of them had a cold smile on their faces.</p>  <p id = > Lynn was also very anxious. She did not expect that it would be a mistake to look for Philip for help. This idiot dared to talk to Dick like that.</p>  <p id = > ‘Get lost if you have no money.  Why even stay here pretending to be cool?’</p>  <p id = > \"Philip, if you don't have any money, just leave. I don't need you to get in the way,\" Lynn said coldly.</p>  <p id = > Kyle, Jacob, and the others also followed suit.</p>  <p id = > \"Damn, after such a long time, this idiot doesn't even have a penny and he’s still trying to be cool in front of Dick.\"</p>  <p id = > \"Dick, I don't know this guy. He has nothing to do with us.\"</p>  <p id = > \"Yeah, Dick. Every injustice has its perpetrator and every debt has its debtor. Him offending you really has nothing to do with us.\"</p>  <p id = > These two boys and two girls were trying to cut ties with Philip all at once at this moment.</p>  <p id = > Dick chuckled scornfully a few times. He got up and walked to Philip. Patting him on the shoulder, he sneered. \"Look, who even treats you as a person here?\"</p>  <p id = > Shatter!</p>  <p id = > The wine bottle broke!</p>  <p id = > Philip had picked up the wine bottle directly from the table. After he smashed it, he pointed it at Dick's throat. He spoke sternly, \"Release her, I will pay the money! If you don't believe me, I can stay!\"</p>  <p id = > Dick surrendered with both hands. With his chin held high, his throat rolled. Cold sweat dripped from his forehead. He joked mockingly, \"Brother, be careful. You can't solve the problem by doing this.\"</p>  <p id = > \"F*ck you! Let go of Dick!\"</p>  <p id = > \"You’re f*cking looking for a death wish!\"</p>  <p id = > Dick's men suddenly went berserk. Pointing at Philip furiously, they shouted.</p>  <p id = > There were two people who were immediately prepared to act against Philip.</p>  <p id = > \"Scram! Let’s see who would dare start a fight today!\" Philip roared. The mouth of the broken wine bottle in his hand pierced through Dick's neck. After cutting a layer of skin, fresh blood trickled down.</p>  <p id = > Dick panicked as well. Staring at Philip, he balefully said, \"Do you know whose place this is? If you dare to touch me, believe it or not, no one will be able to get out of here!\"</p>  <p id = > Looking at Dick calmly, Philip said, \"I don't care whose place this is. In short, if you don't release her, I promise that you will go out lying down!\"</p>  <p id = > Dick stared at Philip for a long time. Then, he suddenly grinned and said, \"Okay, I will release her, but you have to stay.\"</p>  <p id = > Lynn stood up hurriedly. She took a few glances at Philip in a panic. She then ran out with a few friends.</p>  <p id = > They did not care about Philip's safety at all.</p>  <p id = > Seeing that Lynn and the others had run out, Dick smiled viciously. \"Look, this is your sister-in-law. She ran away. She doesn’t care about your life and death. Is it worth it?</p>  <p id = > \"Besides, I heard them say that you’re a good-for-nothing? But I don't think you look like it at all. You are quite courageous.\"</p>  <p id = > Philip did not want to talk nonsense with them at all. He took out his cell phone and called George. \"Starlight Bar. Send 100,000 dollars over.\"</p>  <p id = > He did not bring the card George had given when he went out today.</p>  <p id = > \"Okay Young Master, I'll send it to you right away,\" George responded.</p>  <p id = > Lynn and the others had not run far.</p>  <p id = > Kyle yelled, \"Lynn, your cousin-in-law is f*cking trying to act cool, huh?\"</p>  <p id = > \"That's Dick Jayson. He actually dared to put his hands on him just now. I think he is finished. Even if he doesn’t end up dead, he’ll at least be disabled!\" Kai also agreed.</p>  <p id = > \"That's right, a good-for-nothing like him still dares to act cool. He really almost killed us.\" Several of Lynn's best friends rolled their eyes and cursed with disgust.</p>  <p id = > Lynn was having mixed feelings.</p>  <p id = > Although she looked down on Philip and thought that he was useless, Philip had still stayed there alone for her and her friends.</p>  <p id = > \"Enough, you guys. Stop speaking!\" Lynn was very dissatisfied with her friends. Crossing her arms in front of her chest, she impatiently said, \"I have to go back and have a look. You guys can go first.\"</p>  <p id = > After that, Lynn turned around. She returned to the door of the bar, standing there hesitantly for a long time.</p>  <p id = > Kyle and the others thought about it for a long time. They also turned back. They were waiting sneakily.</p>  <p id = > At this time, a few black Maybachs suddenly stopped at the entrance of the bar!</p>  <p id = > The sight was very luxurious. From the looks of it, there must be a big shot inside the car!</p>  <p id = > The door opened. The person walking down the car was a middle-aged man in a black suit. He had a chiseled face and a mustache. There was a serious expression on his face.</p>  <p id = > There were two burly bodyguards following behind him.</p>  <p id = > \"Holy crap, it's over! It's Master Nino! Now your cousin-in-law is really done for!\"</p>  <p id = > Kyle recognized the middle-aged man immediately.</p>  <p id = > That man was Nino Gil, Riverdale’s third-largest underground force!</p>  <p id = > He was the boss behind El Ninos!</p>  <p id = > Seven years ago, he led El Ninos on a rampage in Riverdale and carved his own world.</p>  <p id = > Before that, he was just an ordinary tiler. Then, he gathered gangsters to help developers deal with the demolition problem with violence.</p>  <p id = > He had unshakable support backing him.</p>  <p id = > Due to his cruel and violent methods, he had won many of the developer’s contracts for demolition projects.</p>  <p id = > Seven years ago, Nino Gil began to contract a large number of demolition projects in Riverdale. He recruited a group of miscellaneous staff specifically for removing the ‘holdouts’ of the demolition project. Relying on illegal means, Riverdale Hartford Construction and Architecture Company was established not long after. He was also promoted to the chairman of the company.</p>  <p id = > A big boss like him was definitely not to be messed with!</p> <p id = > This Starlight Bar was Nino Gil's place!</p> <p id = > Philip was dead meat!</p>   <h2 id =chapter-100 > Chapter 100</h2> <p id = > Lynn and the others watched Nino lead his people into the bar.</p>  <p id = > This was one of the underground bosses of Riverdale!</p>  <p id = > The power and capital behind Nino were even more powerful and terrifying!</p>  <p id = > Kyle was so terrified that he had goosebumps all over his skin. His mouth was trembling as he said, \"We have to leave quickly. If Master Nino catches us, we will definitely be dead!\"</p>  <p id = > Kyle was scared out of his wits. He was only fortunate to have seen Master Nino show off his power before!</p>  <p id = > Harry, who once caused a disturbance in Riverdale, had knelt and spoke in front of Master Nino.</p>  <p id = > After witnessing this scene, Kyle told himself in his heart that if he were to provoke someone, it better not be Master Nino.</p>  <p id = > He was too strong!</p>  <p id = > Moreover, his methods were extremely vicious!</p>  <p id = > Harry, who had been previously undefeated in the hundred rounds of underground black boxing, did not listen to Master Nino's words and refused to fight with fake punches. In the end, he had his hands and feet broken before getting thrown onto the street.</p>  <p id = > Jacob also turned blue with fright and stammered to the two sisters, \"Lynn, let's go. There is nothing nice to see here. Your cousin-in-law himself is courting death by having provoked Dick Jayson. Now that Master Nino is here, he’s done for!\"</p>  <p id = > \"Yeah, Lynn. Let's quickly go or else you will be inviting trouble on yourself. Do you really want to go back? If Dick Jayson gets caught, we will all have to work in service to pay back the money.\"</p>  <p id = > \"Lynn, if you still won’t leave, we will!\"</p>  <p id = > Lynn was also at a loss.</p>  <p id = > Could she really leave Philip like this?</p>  <p id = > No matter how one put it, it was still her who had called Philip here. If something really happened, how would she explain it to her cousin?</p>  <p id = > \"No, if something happens to Philip, we won't be able to escape the responsibility. If you are afraid, then go first. I have to stay,\" Lynn said solemnly.</p>  <p id = > Did this little lass really care that much about Philip?</p>  <p id = > No!</p>  <p id = > She was just worried that if something happened to Philip, she would be implicated.</p>  <p id = > She wanted to stay for confirmation. If things really went bad, she would just call the police.</p>  <p id = > Back at the bar.</p>  <p id = > Philip stood in the middle of everyone’s glaring gazes. With a calm expression, he said, \"Dick Jayson, right? The money will be sent right away.\"</p>  <p id = > Dick drew a tissue, wiped the blood from his neck, and snorted. \"F*ck! You are the first to do this to me.\"</p>  <p id = > After that, the two men rushed directly toward Philip and pressed him onto the sofa.</p>  <p id = > \"Tell me, how do you plan to solve this?\" Dick smiled coldly.</p>  <p id = > \"An additional 100,000 bucks for medical expenses,\" Philip said calmly.</p>  <p id = > Dick smiled and looked around. \"Brothers, did you hear that? He said that he’s willing to give us 200,000 bucks.\"</p>  <p id = > After laughing, he stared at Philip coldly and said, \"Lynn told us that you are a piece of trash who lives off women. I’m curious where your confidence comes from. And where do you plan on getting that 200,000 bucks?\"</p>  <p id = > Dick was not a foolish person. Since Philip’s aura and words did not meet the standard of that a wimp, he must have his own confidence.</p>  <p id = > Besides, he really minded the conversation Philip had just now over the phone.</p>  <p id = > He opened his mouth to immediately ask the other party to send 100,000 bucks over. He was definitely not an ordinary person.</p>  <p id = > Was he pretending to be a pig and eat a tiger instead?</p>  <p id = > Dick really wanted to see if a wimp could bring him 200,000 dollars.</p>  <p id = > \"You just want money. As for my business, I advise you to ask less,” said Philip calmly.</p>  <p id = > Dick shook his head and very naturally, leaned on the sofa. He snapped his fingers and said to his opponent, \"Ten minutes. If no one sends the money by then, cripple his arms and throw him out.\"</p>  <p id = > \"Okay, Dick,\" one person responded with a grin.</p>  <p id = > However...</p>  <p id = > Philip was laughing disapprovingly.</p>  <p id = > It was also at this time that the door of the bar opened and a group of people walked in. They were led by Master Nino.</p>  <p id = > He walked in with a smile and said, \"Dick, why is the door closed in broad daylight?\"</p>  <p id = > Dick was still sitting on the sofa. When he saw Master Nino, he stood up like a frightened rabbit. He bent over and smiled, \"Master Nino, you’re here. If you had told me about your arrival in advance, I would have gone out to greet you in person.\"</p>  <p id = > Master Nino smiled, took off his jacket, sat on the sofa, and said, \"There are some distinguished guests coming to have fun tonight. You have to make preparations quickly. It must be ceremonious and grand. You understand?\"</p>  <p id = > \"Understood, Master Nino. Don't worry, for you, I will definitely make this place beautiful.\"</p> <p id = > It was also at this time that Nino discovered the stranger at the bar. He pointed at Philip, frowned, and asked coldly, \"Who is this kid? Is he new here?\"</p>  <p id = > It was too unruly.</p>  <p id = > He had already come in, but this man was still sitting.</p>  <p id = > Was he not giving him face?</p>  <p id = > Dick immediately made eyes and motioned to some of his subordinates. He smilingly said, \"Master Nino, you’ve misunderstood. This kid is here to pay back the money for his sister-in-law.\"</p>  <p id = > Saying that, he turned his head and shouted at his subordinates, \"Why are you still blanking and not taking him down?\"</p>  <p id = > Philip did not want to nitpick matters. When he got up, he was prepared to leave with the others.</p>  <p id = > However, he heard Dick and Nino discussing a person.</p>    <h2 id =chapter-100 > Chapter 100</h2>  <p id = > Lynn and the others watched Nino lead his people into the bar. This was one of the underground bosses of Riverdale! The power and capital behind Nino were even more powerful and terrifying! Kyle was so terrified that he had goosebumps all over his skin.

He bent over and smiled,</p>  <p id = > \"Master Nino, you’re here.

When he got up, he was prepared to leave with the others. However, he heard Dick and Nino discussing a person.</p>   <h2 id =chapter-101 > Chapter 101</h2>  <p id = > \"Last time, that Lynn you mentioned was pretty good. She’s so full of life.</p>  <p id = > I also brought her over this time and the guest appointed her to accompany them,\" Nino said with a lustful tone. \"Hearing from you, she also has a cousin. Wynn something? She’s a famous beauty in our city, a young married woman. Bring her here too. Maybe the guests will like her too. Two sisters... Surely there will be interest.\" Dick immediately understood and replied, “Master Nino, don't worry. That little girl owes us 100,000 dollars.</p>  <p id = > I heard her cousin is also short on money for her daughter’s surgery recently.\" \"Very good. Do it now.\" Master Nino laughed. Philip frowned.</p>  <p id = > He thought that only Lynn was involved with this. Unexpectedly, they wanted to drag Wynn into this matter as well! Then, they should not blame him for being rude! As such, Philip did not leave. He stopped, turned around, and walked to Nino with a cold expression on his face. \"I say, what's</p>  <p id = > the problem? Why haven't you handled this kid yet!\" Dick was on fire. Were these men all good-for-nothings? Nino was also very unhappy. What he hated most was having his words being heard by someone other than his people. As he was a suspicious man, he was always worried that the other person had been sent undercover by his opponents. \"Master Nino?\" Philip said coldly. Nino raised his brows, a wicked smile appearing at the corners of his mouth. He said, \"Why, do you know me?\" Philip uttered in a cold voice and said, \"Lynn is my sister-in-law. Wynn is my wife.\" This very simple sentence quickly calmed down the bar. Nino was startled. Dick patted his head in annoyance, gritted his teeth, and muttered, \"Forget about this.\" \"Such a coincidence? Why don't you come here to have fun tonight?\"</p>  <p id = > Nino said in disdain. He did not take Philip seriously. Did he think Master Nino would not dare to touch his sister-in-law and wife? The people present were all looking at Philip coldly with mocking eyes. This kid was done for today. He had provoked Master Nino! He should just wait for his entire family to be exterminated. Such a cruel character Nino was. Everyone knew in their hearts that as long as he wanted it, he must get it! \"I don't want to cause trouble, but if anyone dares to strike my family members, I'm sorry, even if he is the king of heaven, I will get them!\" Philip said loudly. In the bar, everyone's eyes fell on Philip. At first, he was shocked by his words, but it was followed by ruthless ridicule and laughter. Where did he think this was? Did he not know that this was Master Nino’s place? Did he not know that Nino was a ruthless person? \"Is your kid f*cking looking for death?\" Nino was furious in an instant! Ever since he came to have power, he had never heard anyone talk to him like this. Mess with him? As Master Nino was furious, Dick immediately brought a few of his men around. \"Boy, hurry up and apologize to Master Nino or I will cut your tongue!\" Dick threatened, his face menacing. However, Philip raised his eyebrows and sneered in front of everyone. \"He is not qualified enough for me to apologize to him.\" Not qualified? Dick was startled! He was really shocked by Philip's spirit that was not afraid of death. It was insane! He was too arrogant! He</p>  <p id = > dared say that Master Nino was not qualified! \"Dick, cut off his hands and feet. Cut off his tongue and soak it in wine!\" Nino's face was cold, and his eyes showed coldness. However, Philip immediately took out his mobile phone and dialed a number. Theo Zander! In an instant, the call was connected and Theo's voice came from the other end, \"Mr. Clarke, do you have any instructions?\" \"Starlight Bar’s Master Nino. Do you know him?</p>  <p id = > Bring your people here. I want to remove him from Riverdale!\" Philip said calmly. The audience was deathly still!</p>  <h2 id =chapter-102 > Chapter 102</h2>  <p id = > Theo quickly said, “I’ll be there right away, Mr. Clarke.” Once he hung up, Theo took a sharp intake of breath. He was somewhat nervous and even a bit panicked. Did Nino Gil get on Mr. Clarke’s bad side? Well, he had it coming! Over the years, Theo had long since gotten fed up with Nino. The latter was too meddlesome for his own good. Besides, Nino had grown unhappy with his lot too. He was already pulling all sorts of strings in secret to mess with Theo’s territory. Theo just let it slide so far because both of them came from equally powerful backgrounds. Any wars between them should be fought in secret, or so Theo thought. Today, though, Nino had clearly poked the hornets’ nest. In that case, Theo figured, why not give him an extra push for good measure? That way, he could put an end to Nino for good. With that in mind, Theo immediately made a phone call. In the blink of an eye, at least a dozen people leaped to action as a result of that call! All of them were Theo’s closest aides! It would be fair to say that right here and now, Theo had mobilized all of his underground forces in Riverdale. All of his men received the same order, just the one. Surround Nino Gil’s territory and await the cue! Theo’s crack troops had been waiting for this day for far too long. They had always been butting heads with Gil’s El Ninos, but they never dreamed that Theo would suddenly declare war today! Tiger walked into the manor and asked with a frown, “Theo, why are you launching an attack against Nino all of a sudden?” Theo held his hands behind his back</p>  <p id = > and chuckled coldly. “Nino ticked Mr. Clarke off, so Mr. Clarke asked me to send our guys over. Today, we’re eliminating Nino from Riverdale.” With that, he glanced at Tiger, who was looking quite solemn. “What’s the matter? Are you afraid?” Tiger was not afraid. He was just worried. “Theo, is Mr. Clarke really that unfathomable? I mean, that’s the great Nino Gil, Master Nino! If…” “Hahaha! Oh, Tiger, never underestimate what Mr.</p>  <p id = > Clarke is capable of.” Theo patted Tiger’s shoulder and burst out laughing before he continued, “Come on, let’s go to Starlight Bar. Bring the best guys we got, cuz we mustn’t embarrass Mr. Clarke today.” That day, the Riverdale underground scene was a flurry of nervous action. As for Philip Clarke, he stood by perfectly calmly after he made that call, watching everything unravel without a word. “What did you say? They want to eliminate our Master Nino?” Dick Jayson sneered, his expression brutal and bloodthirsty. The punk must have lost his mind! Who would dare to eliminate Master Nino from Riverdale? Even Theo Zander would not dare to make such a bold claim! Was this punk even more powerful than Theo, then? “F*ck me, I can’t believe anyone has the balls to say something like that to Master Nino! He must have a death wish!” They started to taunt him, their jeers and laughter filling the hall at the bar. In the face of their boos and hisses, Philip just shook his head quietly. These guys thought too highly of themselves. What they did not know was that there was always someone better out there. Philip did not want to show off. He did not want to pick any fights, but they forced his hand. “I admire your guts, kid, but guts ain’t bulletproof. I’ve been in this business for more than a decade now, and I’ve seen everything. Riverdale is my territory, and yet you’re trying to take me down? Are you that baselessly confident? Or do you have someone behind your back supporting you?” Nino laughed coldly, his expression distant and cool as he looked at Philip. He did not believe that this plain-looking fellow dared to speak to him, the great Nino Gil, like that. That was why he was certain that the punk had a protector of some kind. That must be why he was so gutsy. Even so, Nino was not the least bit worried. Could the punk’s</p>  <p id = > support system overpower Nino’s own? Never in a million years! “Hmph.”</p>  <p id = > Philip’s expression was calm. He figured it was almost time. Just then, a black Audi A8L stopped outside the bar entrance. The car door opened and a middle-aged man of about forty or fifty alighted from the back seat. He was immaculately dressed and had the air of a gentleman. Behind him, he was followed by a tall foreign woman with blonde hair and blue eyes. Kyle and the others were hiding in a corner. When he saw the man get out of the car, he was instantly stunned into stammering, “That’s… I saw him on TV</p>  <p id = > before. He’s the secretary to the richest guy in town, George Thomas!</p>  <p id = > What’s he doing here?” The rest of them exchanged looks of utter confusion. The secretary to the richest man in Riverdale naturally had plenty of clout to his name. So why was he here at Starlight Bar, and looking like he was in such a hurry, too? Lynn looked completely perplexed too. First there was Master Nino, and now there was the richest guy’s secretary. What was going on in this bar? “Lynn, are these guys all here for your useless cousin-in-law over there?” asked one of her girl friends suspiciously. Lynn felt a moment of panic, and she hurriedly denied the possibility. “No way!</p>  <p id = > You know what Philip Clarke is like, don’t you?” Even as she said that, though, she felt inordinately anxious. Could they really be after Philip?</p>  <h2 id =chapter-103 > Chapter 103</h2>  <p id = > The air in the bar right now was eerily cold and heavy. All of a sudden! One of Nino’s lackeys ran over to his boss and whispered into Nino’s ear,</p>  <p id = > “Master Nino, Mr. Thomas’ secretary, Mr. Thane is here. He says he needs to meet you urgently.” “Mr. Thane?” Nino immediately leaped to his feet, beside himself with excitement. “What are you waiting for? Let’s go greet Mr. Thane!” His lackeys opened a path in front of him. Nino was clearly exhilarated. After all, that was the Mr. Julian Thane, chief secretary to the richest man in the city, George Thomas. It was quite the honor to have him here on Nino’s turf! There was a saying in Riverdale. Where Mr. Thane went, there went George Thomas’s will. However… Before Nino could</p>  <p id = > approach Julian, the latter had already walked into the bar with the young blonde-haired, blue-eyed secretary in tow. Who would dare stand in his way? “Oh my, Mr. Thane! It’s been such a long time, how rare to see you here! What winds of fortune blew you here today? I’m quite honored.” Nino instantly toadied up to Julian, his manner respectful, his back bent and his head lowered. He offered Julian a handshake, his smile as flattering as he could make it. Nevertheless, Julian only gave Nino a cool and distant glance.</p>  <p id = > Before he headed here, Mr. Thomas had already instructed him to follow the young master’s lead in everything. That was why… Julian did not even shake Nino’s outstretched hand, walking right past him and into the club.</p>  <p id = > That made the corners of Nino’s mouth twitch. He did not appreciate that, but he maintained the beaming smile on his face. However... What happened next wiped the grin off Nino’s face. It left him standing there in shock, unable to formulate a single word! “Sorry I’m late, Young Master.” Julian walked briskly up to Philip and then gave him a respectful ninety-degree bow. A deathly silence fell across the club! The temperature plummeted!</p>  <p id = > Everyone was flabbergasted! What the hell was going on here? Mr. Thane was bowing to that pathetic waste of space and calling him “Young Master”? Nino’s face was spasming, and Dick was in an utter state of panic!</p>  <p id = > Anyone with enough experience with the world naturally understood what was happening here. This was bad. They offended someone they should not have. “Give him two hundred thousand,” Philip said calmly, pointing at Dick who was standing next to them. Julian did not hesitate for a second.</p>  <p id = > He waved his hand and the young blonde secretary next to him immediately opened up the suitcase she was carrying with her. It was filled to the brim with money! She took out twenty stacks of notes and tossed them onto the coffee table. Dick was in a right tizzy now. His knees felt weak, and he hurriedly said, his expression sheepish, “No, no, no, it’s quite alright.” As if he dared to accept that two hundred thousand! That would mean signing his own death warrant! Philip ignored him, fixing his gaze on Nino instead. He said calmly, “What do you think I’ll do to you, Nino Gil?” Nino was a gang</p>  <p id = > leader, after all. He had spent so many years in the underworld, so of course he had his own connections and resources. Naturally, he was not going to fall to his knees and lick the ground Philip stood on just because Julian Thane called him “Young Master”. Instead, he just chuckled, his attitude far less condescending than it had been earlier. With an air of coolness, he said,</p>  <p id = > “Young Master Clarke, it was my bad for offending you earlier. I sincerely apologize for that. Shall we let bygones be bygones, then?” Nino was not feeling particularly pleased right now. All these years, he had never bent his head to anyone like this. Still, that was Julian Thane. He could not ignore Julian’s position in society. If Nino really did make an enemy of Julian’s young master, that could only spell tragedy for him. There was one thing Nino could not understand, though. If the punk really was all that, why did he act like he was broke and weak? Was that a trend these days?</p>  <p id = > Unfortunately, Philip ignored Nino’s olive branch. The way he saw it, Nino had insulted his wife and cousin-in-law. That was not something Philip was going to let slide. That was why he said perfectly calmly, “Did you forget what I just said?” He was going to eliminate Nino from the city! Nino’s body gave a shudder, and he frowned deeply. His mouth spread into a vicious grin as he said, “Master Clarke, don’t make unnecessary enemies.</p>  <p id = > I’m not someone you can trample all over.” At his cue, his lackeys from all throughout the bar surrounded them, threatening to overwhelm Philip by sheer force of numbers. However, Philip just watched all of this unfold, cool as a cucumber. Julian and the blonde secretary were completely composed as they stood next to Philip too. They clearly did not see Nino as a threat at all. These blundering fools may look like the tyrants of Riverdale to outsiders, but to them or to Master Clarke, Nino and his gang were no more than ants squirming on the ground. They could be squished with a mere finger! “Haha! Well then, let’s see what happens when I do try to trample over you, Nino!” Philip said icily, his gaze filled with frost. Anyone who crossed Wynn must be destroyed!</p>  <h2 id =chapter-104 > Chapter 104</h2>  <p id = > Nino’s expression changed. Having plied in this trade for so many years, he had seen people from all walks of life. He knew them all. Today, however, he felt as though he was facing a completely unfathomable enemy. Philip’s aura was just too unique. It exerted a pressure on Nino unlike any other. It was almost as though this plain-looking man had a very exceptional background., No, not almost. He definitely did! That was the feeling Nino got from Philip after he spoke earlier. Still, Nino was no spineless coward himself. He chuckled twice coldly and said, “Are you sure you want to go against me, Master Clarke? Yes, Mr. Thane is here, but don’t forget, I’m a leader of the Riverdale underworld. No matter how much power Mr.</p>  <p id = > Thane’s boss has, he might want to reconsider before he removes me.” That was right. Nino was talking about George Thomas. The way he saw it, Philip was only acting so bold now because he had the support of George Thomas’s money and reputation. If they really wanted to escalate this into a brawl, Nino had plenty of thugs at his beck and call. That was how he made it big as a young man. This was his turf. Besides, Nino had quite the support system too. He was backed by a very formidable person. If they truly made this into a war, all he had to do was call that man out here for a few words. That would make even George Thomas pause for a good while.</p>  <p id = > For businessmen, every investment could affect their entire fortune if they were not careful. However… Contrary to Nino’s expectations, Philip just smiled mildly and said, “You think too highly of yourself, Nino, and you’re underestimating me by a mile. It doesn’t matter who you are, how many men you have, or who you have behind your back. If I, Philip Clarke, want to get rid of you, no one would dare to stop me!” He was unbelievably cocky! Every word oozed a wild pride! Nino’s frown deepened, and his expression grew ever darker. Grinning viciously, he said, “Are you sure you want to do this, Master Clarke?” Philip did not reply, but his attitude was answer enough. Nino did not drag his feet either. He took two steps back,</p>  <p id = > and several dozen thugs flooded out into the bar from all directions. They were all gangsters and hooligans, armed with sticks, bats, and a desire to maim. “Do it!” Nino roared angrily, following up with a loud, “But don’t kill them!” Nino had everything all planned out. He was going to capture Master Clarke and Mr. Thane and teach them a little lesson. That would tell them not to mess with him. Once he had them captive, he would immediately call his patron and ask the latter to solve this matter for him.</p>  <p id = > After all, Mr. Thane was George Thomas’s man. Nino did not have enough clout to attack Thomas’s men without repercussions, at least not yet. As the gang rounded in on them rapidly, Philip and the others did not look panicked in the slightest. Philip just looked at them quietly. At the same time, outside the bar… Several dozen black MPVs surged down the road and surrounded Starlight Bar in the blink of an eye! In complete unison, forty or fifty bodyguards dressed in black suits and black leather shoes with black sunglasses and white gloves got out of the cars. They quickly stood in two lines, opening a path to the bar entrance! After that, a black Jaguar with a black license plate, RVD C77777, stopped at the door! It was quite the spectacle! The atmosphere turned extremely tense! The car door opened, and Theo walked out, dressed from head to toe in a white suit. He took the fedora off his head and looked at the door to Starlight Bar, which was tightly shut. This was his trademark entrance. Just one glance from him was enough. Dressed in camo, Tiger had followed him out of the car. He waved his large hand and forcefully stormed down the door with his men! After that, Theo led the way into the bar. His men streamed inside with him in two orderly lines. Of course, Lynn and the others who were hiding in the corner witnessed the entire magnificent scene first-hand. Kyle had long since been shocked out of his wits. He fell bottom-first onto the floor, stammering non-stop, “It’s over, it’s all over! T-Theo… Theo Zander, the emperor of Riverdale's underworld! H-He’s here too!” Theo Zander, Riverdale’s underground emperor! That name and title filled their ears like the toll of death bells. Everyone from eight-year-old children to eighty-year-old</p>  <p id = > grandpas in Riverdale knew Theo Zander’s name! He was definitely a monster among monsters! Judging by the men Theo had brought with him, there was an astronomical storm brewing here! Starlight Bar seemed exceptionally popular today! Kyle was so freaked out that he simply ran away with his tail between his legs. He did not dare to stay here any longer.</p>  <p id = > It was just too scary! The other two girls were no better. They were so nervous that they could barely speak, and they tried to drag Lynn away.</p>  <p id = > “C’mon, Lynn, we should go. We can’t help! First there was Master Nino, and now there’s Master Theo? Your cousin-in-law is dead meat for sure now.” “Hurry, let’s run! If they catch us, we’ll be dead too.” “Let’s call the cops! I doubt that Philip Clarke can make it out of this in one piece, so hurry and call the cops! Maybe that way he won’t die, at least.” The few of them talked over each other, all of them pale as death. Lynn was utterly terrified too. If something really happened to Philip, she would definitely be implicated in it as well. Should she leave? Should she call the cops? While she hesitated, all hell broke loose in the club. A dozen of Nino’s hired hands surrounded Philip and the others, bloodlust plain on their faces. “Get them!”</p>  <p id = > Dick roared. The men pounced.</p>  <h2 id =chapter-105 > Chapter 105</h2>  <p id = > Impressive scene, was it not? However, that was not the full extent of it yet!</p>  <p id = > It happened out of nowhere! Suddenly, there were a few loud crashes in the bar! Seven or eight people came flying out of the corridors on either side of the entrance! They were all Nino’s men! A group of brawlers dressed in black suits surged into the main hall of the bar! Leading the pack was none other than Tiger Zander, with his well-built body and an air of violence about him! All by himself, he faced off against a dozen thugs, all armed with bats! These men were the ones Nino had tasked with guarding the door.</p>  <p id = > When faced with Tiger, though, none of them stood a chance. They were all beaten flat onto the floor! Nino looked furious when he heard the commotion. He glared at the door and saw Theo walk out from behind the</p>  <p id = > crowd slowly, wearing a smile that seriously ticked him off. “Zander! What are you up to? This is my turf! Why did you bring so many of your men here?!” Nino was beside himself. He never expected Theo to crash his party with his men. The two of them had been at loggerheads for years, but they never clashed as openly as today. What was Zander up to? Did he want another bloodbath like what happened five years ago? Had he forgotten the deal they made back then? However, Theo ignored Nino completely. He just strode up to Philip, bent his waist and lowered his head, saying respectfully,</p>  <p id = > “Mr. Clarke, I brought forty of my best men. Also, I already ordered my guys to surround Nino’s clubs, companies, and even El Ninos’s taekwondo dojo. You just have to say the word, sir, and Nino Gil’s presence will be uprooted from Riverdale this very day.” Theo went straight to the point, explaining all of his arrangements and plans. He had been waiting for this day for many years now. Nevertheless… Nino only burst out laughing when he heard all that. “Are you f*cking insane too, Zander? Even you’re trying to get at me using this guy?” Nino did panic for a second when he heard Theo’s report. After a second, though, he found it hilarious. He had at least several dozen clubs and companies altogether! How could they uproot so many organizations so easily? Even if they had the power to do it, it was not something that could be done at a single word, right? Besides, it was not as though Nino was completely defenseless! Theo turned around and looked at Nino expressionlessly. His tone was cold as he said, “Nino Gil, all these years, we’ve kept our little skirmishes under wraps and within reason.</p>  <p id = > Today, however, you never should have made an enemy of Mr. Clarke.</p>  <p id = > Since he said he wants to get rid of you, I’ll follow his order to the letter!”</p>  <p id = > “Haha, very well! I can’t believe that the great Theo Zander, the most powerful man in Riverdale, takes his orders from a brat! What do you take me for, a f*cking toddler? ! I ain’t scared of you!” Nino bellowed angrily.</p>  <p id = > With one swift motion, he pulled out his phone and called a number, “Hey, Rio! Bring some men over to Starlight, as many as possible! ASAP! This is war!” There was an instant reply from the other end. “Yessir, Master Nino!</p>  <p id = > I’ll bring some men right… What the f*ck! Who the hell are you guys?!</p>  <p id = > Who let you in here!” “Everybody, freeze! We’re from Joint Law Enforcement, you’re all under arrest! Get to the ground!” Nino paused, his panic showing on his face. From over the phone, he could hear the sounds of a fight and even some gunshots! At the same time, a rather stern voice came across his speaker. “Nino, Mikael Chance here. We’ve been waiting for this day for a long time now. I’m sure we’ll meet very soon.” Mikael Chance! The captain of the law enforcement team! He had had his eye on Nino for a long time now, but he just never managed to find the evidence he needed. Just slightly over ten minutes ago, though, he received an anonymous letter with all the proof of Nino’s crimes! It was irrefutable proof! That was why he immediately mobilized several dozen of his team members and some men from the border patrol. He brought more than two hundred men, all armed to the teeth with real ammunition, and surrounded El Ninos’s taekwondo dojo! It was taken down in one fell swoop! That news caught Nino completely off-guard. He was properly panicked now. Still, he had experience with crises before. Without hesitation, he called another number he rarely ever contacted. “Hello, Master Zach? I’m in a bit of trouble here, you gotta help me.” That was Nino’s trump card! An extremely powerful man! Someone so mysterious that he had no idea where his limits lay!</p>  <h2 id =chapter-106 > Chapter 106</h2>  <p id = > Master Zach. The power and authority he wielded were beyond the imagination! Even Nino, to this day, had no idea just how far Master Zach's influence spread. Once, Master Zach showed Nino just a tiny hint of what he could do, and that was enough to make Nino respect and follow him with all his heart. There was an A-list celebrity named Elsa Jordan. She was practically a goddess to legions of fans, and she had a lot of say in the world of showbiz as well. Plenty of famous directors and entrepreneurs gave her the best seat at their tables. Even someone like had to keep a careful smile</p>  <p id = > on her face when she spoke to Master Zach back then. Apparently, Master Zach had relationships with many female celebrities in showbiz. There were all sorts of rumors and unwritten rules around him. The internet was rife with them. So what happened in the end? Old Master Zach just had one thing to say. “If anyone has anything more to say, I’ll deal with you myself!”</p>  <p id = > Every bad rumor about Master Zach vanished without a trace, as though nothing had ever happened. All because Old Master Zach was angry. No one ever dared to make Old Master Zach angry. The old man had a finger in countless pies all across the country. Even the bigwigs in some very special fields were closely related to the Zachs. As for Master Zach, he was the youngest in the three generations of the family, Old Master Zach’s favorite youngest grandson. In other words, he was basically royalty! That was why Nino believed that Julian Thane and George Thomas meant nothing as long as he had Master Zach on his side! The Zachs were insanely, obscenely wealthy! Master Zach alone was worth several million, and that was just his personal fortune! Could you even imagine how much he really had? “Nino, why the panic?” The voice on the other end was slightly deep and somewhat lilting, with an air of mystery. There also seemed to be sweet, feminine laughter and loud house music. Nino gave Theo and Philip a dark look before saying, “Master Zach, Theo Zander made his move, and he has a man I don’t know with him. Zander treats the guy really respectfully, and that’s the guy who’s trying to wipe out all my forces. They took over my turf a few minutes ago. Master Zach, you gotta help me this time.” “A man Theo Zander respects? Interesting. Pass him the phone,” Master Zach said with a calm smile. Nino seemed to find his courage again, passing the phone to Philip with a cocky look. “Master Clarke, our Master Zach wants to speak to you.” His expression was bold and his attitude was unbelievably arrogant.</p>  <p id = > Right now, Nino felt invincible. He had Master Zach on his side. What was there to be scared of? Theo Zander? George Thomas! They were all just trash! That was right. Nino was drunk on power! He had his own plans.</p>  <p id = > Since Master Zach was already going to stand up for him, he was going to</p>  <p id = > try and take over Theo’s entire territory today! Philip calmly accepted the phone and heard a light chuckle across the receiver. “Nino tells me that you and Theo want to take over his turf, hmm?” The voice sounded quite confident. That was not a question; instead, it was quite a rude jest. The entire bar was pin-drop silent right now. No one dared to even breathe too loudly. After all, Nino’s and Theo’s forces were standing off against each other. Philip raised an eyebrow and said calmly, “Caleb Zach, I take it?”</p>  <p id = > There was silence on the other end, abruptly broken by a cold laugh. “Well, well, to think you recognize me. Who are you?” Cocky, arrogant, rude.</p>  <p id = > Philip curled the corners of his mouth mischievously and said, extremely calm, “I’m Philip Clarke.” Smack! The call was ended in a split second. It was quite decisive. In fact, it was so decisive that even Philip was left a little stunned. Was that punk that scared of him? After all that time, did he still remember what happened back then? At the same time, in a private manor somewhere, there was an open-air pool party. Right that moment, there was a handsome young man surrounded by seven or eight beautiful women in bikinis. He wore floral boxers and sunglasses, but his masculine features looked eerily terrified. Caleb Zach was actually scared out of his wits right now! Philip Clarke?! F*ck, f*ck, f*ck! Why was that guy at Nino’s place?!</p>  <p id = > Just to make sure, Caleb called again. The call went through soon enough, and that familiar voice from his distant past reached his ears once more.</p>  <p id = > “Remember me?” F*ck! Caleb inwardly burst out swearing! It really was him!</p>  <h2 id =chapter-107 > Chapter 107</h2>  <p id = > Caleb was by nature smug and intolerably haughty. All his life, he never once feared anyone. He was quite the classic spoiled rich kid. Unfortunately, however, in his twenty-odd years of life, there was only one person who ever scared him. Just one! That man! The man who had become his nightmare! Proud? Haughty? No one in this world could be prouder or haughtier than that man, Philip Clarke! Caleb still remembered how, so</p>  <p id = > many years ago, that man had come to the capital city with an entourage of special clearance vehicles clearing the traffic for him! Crazy, right? Yet it was true! It was all because Philip had waved his hand and casually said that he would gift the special forces with some cutting-edge military equipment and techniques from abroad. Just like that, those high-ranking officials flooded the hotel Philip was staying in. Back then, Caleb was still young.</p>  <p id = > His family was rich and powerful, so he did not think twice about offending Philip. Where did that land him? Old Master Zach did not even dare to protest. He simply paid Philip a visit with Caleb in tow to beg for forgiveness. He even broke one of Caleb’s legs! It was all because Philip casually wondered aloud if the Zachs should be allowed to keep existing.</p>  <p id = > As a result, Old Master Zach led his entire family to apologize to Philip!</p>  <p id = > That incident caused an 8.0 scale earthquake in the capital city back then!</p>  <p id = > Almost a hundred people knelt in front of the hotel Philip was staying in, lined up according to their seniority. That was right. The impeccable Zachs, practically royalty in these parts, all knelt in front of the hotel door with Old Master Zach himself taking the lead. They simply begged for Philip’s forgiveness. It was shocking! It was unbelievable! Of course, the media was later ordered to cover the whole incident up. Who would dare report something like that? The Zachs alone would be enough to shut any media outlets or reporters down. Now, Caleb was panicking. He was truly afraid, from the bottom of his heart. He did not have time to put on his clothes. He just grabbed his phone and hurriedly yelled at his butler, “Hurry, book me a damn flight ticket! For today, I want to go back to the capital! Right now, damn it! I can’t stay here a second longer!” Caleb only had one thought in mind right now, and that was to run! Nino had angered Philip! He must be asking for death! No, he was going to get something worse than death! Just then, however, his phone rang again, sounding like the tolling of his death bells. Did Caleb dare to pick up? Not at all! After some hesitation, he forced a smile and answered the call, cold sweat covering his brow. “Hello, M-Master Clarke. Are you back in town?” On the other end, Philip said very</p>  <p id = > calmly, “Not yet, but Nino Gil ticked me off. How should we handle this?”</p>  <p id = > “Handle him! Do with him as you like! The guy’s just a waste of brain space anyway! A huge idiot! You gotta kill him, Master Clarke! Finish him off! If you don’t want to dirty your hands, I’ll come right down and do it for you!”</p>  <p id = > Caleb’s angry roars emanated from the phone on the coffee table.</p>  <p id = > Meanwhile, Philip sat on the couch calmly. As for Nino, his entire body had gone cold the moment he heard those raging words across the speaker. His patron, that invincible Master Zach, betrayed him just like that? That was not even the scariest part. What was worse was that Master Zach, whose influence was like a bottomless abyss, was actually terrified of Philip Clarke! It was all over! Nino felt dizzy, and his breathing quickened. He fell onto his butt on the floor, his body limp and powerless. The call ended. The bar was terrifyingly quiet. Nino’s men were all completely silent. Even Master Nino had fallen apart. In that case, the rest of them did not even dare to stay on their feet. They dropped their weapons and let Theo’s men press them down onto the ground. At the same time, Philip gave the cue and Theo gave the order accordingly. In an instant, several dozen institutions of all sizes all across Riverdale were immediately taken down by Theo’s men! It was a spectacle to behold! The time, Theo took barely an instant to clean everything up, uprooting all of Nino’s forces clean from the ground! It was all over. Philip stood up coolly and walked past the destroyed Nino. He left just like that, without even saying a word. Theo brought his men and hurriedly followed behind Mr. Clarke. After that, Julian Thane and the lady secretary left the bar as well. Outside the bar, Philip was the first to emerge.</p>  <p id = > Theo personally ran ahead of him and held the Jaguar’s door open for him.</p>  <p id = > On the other side, Julian was also saying something to Philip, his head respectfully lowered. “Mr. Clarke, please get in. I’ll send you back,” Theo said politely with a bow. He had several dozen bodyguards in black suits, and right now all of them were standing solemnly next to their dozen-or-so cars, just waiting for Philip to get into the car. The entire time, Lynn and the others were watching the whole thing unfold from behind a corner in the</p>  <p id = > wall. “Lynn, is that man… your cousin-in-law?” one of her girl friends asked, stammering. “Crap, your cousin-in-law isn’t useless at all! Will he try to get revenge on us?” What they were seeing went beyond comprehension! Those guys were the king of Riverdale’s underworld and George Thomas’s own secretary. Now, both of them were bowing to Philip and listening to his every word! Was he not a useless deadbeat? What was happening here? Lynn had a thousand questions on her mind. At the same time, she gulped nervously. Even Theo Zander had to bow to her useless cousin-in-law. Yet she had insulted and humiliated him in so many ways before. Did that mean that the BMW incident earlier was real too? This…</p>  <p id = > This felt like a dream! Lynn and the others only heaved a sigh of relief when they saw Philip leave in the car. However, they wore identically dazed expressions. That went especially so for Lynn. She was holding her phone and watching the video she had just taken of recent events. She just could not calm herself down. Did she misunderstand something? She needed proof. After a great deal of thought, Lynn sent the video to her cousin Wynn, followed by a panicked voice note, “W… Wynn, did you see the video? Do you know what your husband does for a living?”</p>  <h2 id =chapter-108 > Chapter 108</h2>  <p id = > Wynn was at the hospital, asking everyone she could find if they knew any famous doctors or could lend her any money. It was all to no avail, though.</p>  <p id = > Her classmates left her in the wind at times like these. Even her close friends were nowhere to be seen. After all, they were scared. They knew that she had a useless husband. Who would lend money to a household like that?</p>  <p id = > They would never see the money back again. While Wynn was feeling sorry for herself, her phone rang with a notification. It was from her cousin, Lynn.</p>  <p id = > She tapped on it and saw that it was a video, plus a voice message. Before she clicked on the video, she tapped on the voice note first. Lynn's somewhat panicked voice came across the speakers. \"W… Wynn, did you see the video? Do you know what your husband does for a living?\" Wynn frowned</p>  <p id = > her pretty brows slightly. She did not really understand what Lynn meant, so she clicked on the video. The video was crystal clear. It was obviously Philip! Fancy Jaguars! Several dozen bodyguards dressed in black suits!</p>  <p id = > That man in the white suit treated Philip very respectfully. The more she watched, the more surprised and shocked Wynn felt! Was that really her husband, Philip Clarke? That useless wimp who took all that shade without ever saying a word in return? Who were these people, and why did they treat Philip like a god? All of a sudden, Wynn did not recognize Philip anymore.</p>  <p id = > After a moment of confusion, Wynn immediately gave Lynn a call, saying hurriedly, \"Where did you take this video? What's the meaning of this?\"</p>  <p id = > When Lynn received her cousin's call, she retorted with a question, \"Wynn, do you know what Philip does for a living?\" \"What do you mean, what he does? Who are those people? Did he offend someone? Wait right there, I'll be there in a second!\" Wynn was in a complete panic now. She thought that Philip was in trouble and had been kidnapped. How else was she supposed to explain this video? She did not dare to entertain any other possibilities, because they felt impossible to her. \"I don't know either. He seems… He seems to have changed,\" Lynn said with a stutter. She did not really understand either. He had always been a spineless coward who never said a word out of place. Why was he suddenly so respected by so many? By a mob boss like Theo Zander, too. It was just inexplicable. Wynn was beside herself with worry, and she pestered Lynn to tell her what happened. Of course, Lynn hid a lot of details. After all, she owed him a hundred thousand.</p>  <p id = > If her parents found out about that, things would definitely turn ugly for her.</p>  <p id = > After she hung up, Wynn hastily gave Philip a call. She was bordering on hysterical now, her brow tightly furrowed and her nerves etched into her face. It was a familiar tone. However, no one picked up. She tried again!</p>  <p id = > Still no one picked up. Wynn was properly panicked now. Her heart leaped into her throat. At that moment, she had not yet realized just how she worried about Philip she was. The call went through! \"Wynn? What's the matter? Why did you call me five or six times?\" On the other end, she heard</p>  <p id = > Philip's somewhat lazy drawl. Wynn felt her heart settle back into her chest when she heard that familiar voice. She heaved a sigh of relief and said,</p>  <p id = > \"Where are you?\" Philip could hear that Wynn was worried, so he said with a laugh, \"What's the matter, Wynn? Why are you so nervous?\" \"I asked you a question. Where are you?\" Wynn asked again coolly. Philip told her a lie.</p>  <p id = > \"I'm doing my delivery rounds, of course.\" Wynn's face frosted over the moment she heard Philip lie. \"Come to the hospital. I need to talk to you.\"</p>  <p id = > 'Well, well, Philip Clarke. So now you've learned to lie to me.' Would he need a Jaguar to do his deliveries? Would he need a couple dozen bodyguards? Wynn was quite unhappy right now, so she simply hung up.</p>  <p id = > After that, she lay on the hospital bed in a huff, already running through ten thousand reasons to start a fight with Philip. She picked up her phone, watching the video over and over again. Wynn was perplexed. It did not look like Philip had made enemies he should not have. They did not seem to be taking him away by force. In fact, it looked more like they were respectfully inviting him into the car. Theo had his back turned to the camera, so Wynn did not recognize him, and Lynn did not tell her either.</p>  <h2 id =chapter-109 > Chapter 109</h2>  <p id = > At Starlight Bar right now, Lynn and the others were about to leave in a hurry. However, they had barely gotten a few steps away when a shadow blocked their way. \"Phi… Mr. Clarke.\" Lynn looked up and saw that the one standing in front of her was none other than Philip. As a result, she was so scared that she could not even get a word out properly. Her girl friends and Kyle were huddled together warily as well. They did not even have the guts to raise their heads and look at Philip. That spineless wimp had suddenly metamorphosed into a man even Theo Zander had to respect. Of course they were terrified. Was he here to take revenge on them?</p>  <p id = > However… Philip just frowned and said calmly, \"You saw everything?\"</p>  <p id = > Lynn was quaking in her boots. She stammered for a long time, shaking her head desperately as she said, \"N-No… I didn't see anything.\" What did</p>  <p id = > Philip want? Did he want to kill her so she would not spill his secret? Philip smiled and took Lynn's phone from her. When he saw the video she had sent to Wynn, he frowned deeply and said, \"What else did you tell your cousin?\"</p>  <p id = > He was feeling quite frustrated now. Did Wynn know who he really was now? It was not the right time yet, though! Lynn panicked and hastily shook her head, saying, \"I… I didn't tell her anything.\" Philip casually deleted the video from the phone and returned it to Lynn, saying, \"I'm still your cousin-in-law, don't worry about it. Those guys are just friends I made recently.</p>  <p id = > Don't tell anyone else about this, okay? Not even your cousin. The same goes for the rest of you, hear me?\" His tone was calm and not threatening in the slightest. Even so, Lynn and the others felt a ton of pressure on their shoulders. Lynn never once imagined that she would someday feel this pressure from Philip Clarke! \"Yeah, okay.\" The others hurriedly nodded. \"I returned the money for you, so don't get involved with rabble like that from now on, got it?\" Philip frowned at her like an adult at a child in the family.</p>  <p id = > Before today, Lynn would definitely have slapped or kicked him by now, jabbing a finger at his face and swearing him out. Now, things were different. She did not dare to try that anymore, so she just nodded sheepishly and said, \"Yeah, got it.\" It was only when Philip left on that old scooter that Lynn and the others finally relaxed. Lynn's back was already drenched with sweat, and her long straight legs shook despite her best efforts. \"L-Lynn, your cousin-in-law was terrifying just now.\" \"I've never been so scared of someone just looking at me expressionlessly like that. I nearly peed myself!\"</p>  <p id = > \"We can't afford to offend him! He's no wimp at all, let's stay away from now on.\" They started chattering among themselves. Even though Philip had left, their nerves lingered. Lynn was also simultaneously terrified and curious. Was her cousin-in-law really that amazing? Lynn was an opportunist, so she instantly thought of something once her heart stopped pounding. Since the others did not know about Philip's true identity and she was the only one who did, did that mean she could threaten Philip with this information? Could he perhaps be some secret trust fund kid? Or was he</p>  <p id = > maybe some mob boss? Was he here just to experience the normal life? It was possible! It was very possible! Because even now, the Johnstons still did not know about his past. His parents did not even attend his wedding with Wynn. Once she thought that true, the expression of panic on Lynn's face immediately disappeared, replaced instead with a cold, calculating smile. \"Philip Clarke, now I have finally have dirt on you! Just you wait, you won't be cocky for long, hmph!\" Lynn harrumphed, her gaze sharp and cunning. Back at the hospital… Philip saw Wynn, who was clearly fuming at something. With a sheepish smile, he said, \"What's the matter, Wynn?</p>  <p id = > Why did you call me back so urgently?\" Wynn had already sat up in bed and was now looking at Philip coldly. \"So you've learned how to lie to me, huh?\" Lie? Before Philip could explain, Wynn showed him the video on her phone and demanded, \"Were you doing your delivery rounds here?\" \"No,\"</p>  <p id = > Philip said, scratching his head awkwardly. \"How did you end up with these guys?\" Wynn's expression turned ever colder. If he did not give her a valid reason today, she was definitely going to teach him a real lesson. \"Can…</p>  <p id = > Can I say I don't know them?\" Philip asked calmly. \"You don't know them?</p>  <p id = > Then why did you get into their car?\" Wynn was furious now. Philip thought it over and then pulled himself a chair. Sitting down, he said perfectly calmly, \"I went to find that young man who attacked you earlier. His family is quite rich, so I asked them for compensation.\" \"Oh, you found him?\"</p>  <p id = > Wynn said curiously. Although she was still suspicious, she did feel touched that Philip would go to those lengths for her. \"What did they say?\" she asked. \"I'll be going to discuss the compensation again in the next few days,\"</p>  <p id = > Philip said. Right. The atmosphere in the room turned heavy. \"What do you think about Mila's surgery?\" Wynn asked suddenly, her voice very soft. She seriously seemed to be asking for his opinion. \"I've already contacted a rather famous doctor. If all goes well, we can have her hospitalized tomorrow in preparation for the surgery,\" Philip said, bending down. \"Who's this doctor? Tell me their name and I'll ask Juan to check them out,\" Wynn</p>  <p id = > said abruptly. Philip thought it over and raised an eyebrow slightly, saying,</p>  <p id = > \"Actually, the doctor I found is…\"</p>  <h2 id =chapter-110 > Chapter 110</h2>  <p id = > \"Actually, the doctor I found is Professor Henry Turner.\" Philip decided to tell her in the end. Wynn's movements froze partway through searching up the name on her phone. She looked at him in disbelief. He had contacted Professor Henry Turner? After a brief moment of shock, her expression turned a little strange. She looked at Philip and said coldly, \"Philip Clarke, can you stop joking at a time like this?\" Of course she did not believe him.</p>  <p id = > That was the Professor Henry Turner, the juggernaut of the medical field, a legendary heart specialist. He was renowned both domestically and internationally. How could Philip ever get him on their side? So Wynn just assumed that he was trying to console her. \"Believe me, Wynn, I really did manage to get Professor Turner. I also…\" Philip tried to explain.</p>  <p id = > However… Suddenly, there was a cold sarcastic laugh behind him. \"You sure know how to bluff, Philip. Do you really think you could reach Professor Turner? You? Even if you want to console Wynn, do you really have to go that far?\" Juan had returned to the room again, his expression fully taunting as he strode into the room. After that, he ignored Philip completely and sat on the couch arrogantly. \"Wynn, I've handled the arrangements for Mila's surgery. Professor Turner will take some time out of his schedule to check on her. If there's enough time, I can arrange for Mila to enter the hospital tomorrow itself.\" Was he proud of himself right now? Very much so! He had finally managed to beg Professor Turner to pay them a visit, so of course he wanted to show off in front of Wynn for a while.</p>  <p id = > After all, look at that useless Philip. He was shamelessly telling lies here.</p>  <p id = > How could a useless wimp like him possibly manage to contact Professor Turner? Philip looked somewhat displeased. He had been fed up with Juan for a long time now. He just never did anything about his frustration because of Juan's earlier friendship with him and the way he treated Mila. If Juan</p>  <p id = > really ticked Philip off, he could bankrupt Juan's family with a single word.</p>  <p id = > However, he could not do that now. On the other hand, teaching Juan a little lesson would not hurt. When Wynn heard Juan's declaration, she looked utterly overcome with surprise. She hurriedly scrambled out of bed and sat on the couch, saying gratefully, \"Oh, Juan, thank you so much! I… I don't even know what to say.\" She cried tears of happiness. The pressure weighing on her chest had lightened considerably. Juan gave Philip a smug look and said jeeringly, \"I heard you said that you managed to get Professor Turner just now, huh? Do you really think that he'll help you out just because he put in a word for you this morning?\" \"And why wouldn't he?\" Philip retorted calmly. That was enough to earn him an angry glare from Wynn.</p>  <p id = > \"Philip, what are you doing? Since Juan has already asked him for us, could you stop throwing a wrench into everything?\" She was a little unhappy with Philip's attitude. Could he not thank Juan at least? \"Sure, Philip. Since you say so, shall I call Professor Turner and ask him?\" Juan's smile was utterly conniving, his eyes shining with malicious irony. As he said that, Juan took out his phone and pretended to make that call. Philip looked utterly unaffected. However, Wynn was the one who was not having it. Philip might not mind embarrassing himself, but she definitely did mind. She said hurriedly, \"There's no need to make that call, Juan. You know what Philip is like. Oh yeah, do I need to pay Professor Turner a visit? Should I prepare a gift for him?\" She changed the subject. Juan decided to stop because Wynn said so, but he gave Philip a look of pure contempt, challenging him outright. At the same time, he said, \"It's alright, I'll liaise with Professor Turner. If you really want to thank him, you can wait until after he checks on Mila. There's no rush.\" Philip frowned when he saw Juan and Wynn launching into a conversation, but he did not say anything. Not long later, they heard Martha's upset voice coming from outside the door. \"Wynn, your aunt is here to visit you.\" As soon as she walked in, Martha did not look pleased at all. Her shoulders were hunched and her expression was cloudy.</p>  <p id = > She looked like someone owed her a couple million bucks. As expected, the</p>  <p id = > moment Martha walked in with Wynn's aunt, she saw Philip and immediately turned hostile against him. As though she just wanted to pick a fight, she berated him, \"Why are you here, you useless thing? Get out of here, you annoy me just by seeing you!\" Philip did nothing to deserve that, but her bullets rained down on him anyway.</p>    <h2 id =chapter-111 > Chapter 111</h2>  <p id = > There was a middle-aged woman in her forties or fifties behind Martha. She was very fashionably dressed, a little on the plump side. She had a red LV</p>  <p id = > bag, a jade bangle, a gold chain, and even a stylish older-lady perm.</p>  <p id = > Everyone could feel her aura the moment she walked in. She oozed luxury!</p>  <p id = > That was Martha’s second older sister, Philip and Wynn’s second aunt. Her name was Paula Yates, and she was the second eldest daughter in the family.</p>  <p id = > Martha had never liked her second older sister. The two of them would get into catfights every time they met, over the same old things. Paula had a daughter who married a rich husband. The man had his own company and good connections in society, so Paula’s social status rose accordingly. Life was pretty good for her now. It was obvious in the way she dressed. She reeked of money. It was as though she wanted to wear all of her fortunes wherever she went, so that everyone would envy her. Case in point, Paula gave Philip the stink eye as soon as she walked into the room and saw Philip.</p>  <p id = > “Oh my, isn’t that my dear nephew-in-law, Philip Clarke? How are things</p>  <p id = > for you these days? I hear you’re doing food delivery now. How much do you earn every month? Are you still staying in that tiny 800-square feet house? When are you going to get a bigger place? If you’re out looking, you can ask our Richard. He’s in property, you know, and he can give you a discount.” As she said that, she even touched her new perm to show off the jade bracelet on her wrist. “Oh dear, Richard is such a pain sometimes. I told him not to buy this for me, but he insisted. This bracelet is worth eighty thousand, you know.” Paula spoke to herself casually. When she saw her younger sister’s stormy expression, she covered her mouth with her hand and giggled. “Oh my my, remind me again, Martha. Has Philip ever bought you anything?” She was arrogant, proud, and full of sarcastic barbs. From the moment she walked through the door, Paula had kept her nose firmly in the air. Martha was so furious that her body trembled. She glared at Philip and berated him, “What did I do in my past life to deserve a son-in-law as useless as you? You’re an utter embarrassment to me!” Philip had nothing to say to that. The atmosphere was extremely awkward now. Wynn was rather unhappy now too. Her aunt had always looked down on her family, all because she thought Philip was useless, especially when compared to her rich son-in-law. That was why her aunt would drop by every so often, saying she was here to visit her sister when she actually came to show off and make jabs at them. Wynn was exasperated to have a relative like that too. Still, Paula was her elder. There was nothing Wynn could do. “Why are you here, Aunt Paula?” Wynn interrupted Paula with a smile. Paula was dominating the room. Her presence seemed to fill the place as she took a seat without asking and said with a laugh, “I heard that you were hospitalized, so I came to see how you’re doing.” Haha. Everyone knew why she was really here.</p>  <p id = > Visiting Wynn was just a cover. What she really wanted was to show off.</p>  <p id = > Look at the way she put her LV on her lap and kept playing with it. She wanted everyone to know that she had bought a fancy handbag. That was also when Paula noticed Juan. She pointed at him and asked Martha, “Who’s that, Martha?” Martha finally found a chance to show off. She hastily</p>  <p id = > shoved Philip aside and even glared at him before yanking Juan by the arm and beaming. “Oh, this is Juan. His family is quite well to do, they’re in the gem business and they earn several tens of millions every year too. He’s Wynn’s good friend.” Paula’s eyes seemed to shine when she looked at Juan now. When she saw how proud Martha looked, though, her expression cooled down as well. The two old women had been squabbling like this for years. Of course they understood each other. Martha was probably hoping that Juan could become her new son-in-law. Paula immediately gave them a smile of faux politeness. “Why, what a nice young man.” Inwardly, though, she had cursed Martha to hell and back. Martha wanted a rich sonin-law now? Hmph! Her daughter Wynn was already married and even had a kid. No one would want a woman like that. Still, Paila could not say that out loud. With that thought in mind, she gave Philip a look of pure irony too. Philip Clarke was seriously such a waste of space. Even his mother-in-law wanted to get rid of him. Martha’s heart brightened once she saw that her sister looked displeased. It was rare for her to get an upper hand over Martha, so she immediately pulled Juan over and said, “Why are you just standing there? C’mon, greet your Aunt Paula.” Juan hastily said with a smile, “Hi, Aunt Paula.” Paula reacted like a cat after someone stepped on its tail. She jumped to her feet and said, “Oh no no, you can’t call me that.</p>  <p id = > That’s all wrong! You’re not my nephew-in-law, you can’t call me aunt.”</p>  <p id = > The atmosphere in the room turned instantly awkward. Paula’s reply was undeniably a bright slap across Martha’s face. “Martha, I think Philip is a good man. He’s willing to work hard, right? You shouldn’t scold or hit him so much. After all, you’re still family.” Paula easily lied through her teeth.</p>  <p id = > If Martha did end up getting a rich son-in-law, who else was she supposed to show off to? That was why she must never let Martha’s little plot succeed!</p>  <p id = > Sparks flew around the hospital room. Paula saw how red her younger sister’s face had turned, so she instantly changed the subject. “Oh yeah, Dad’s seventieth birthday is coming up soon. Are you guys attending the party?” Haha. If they went, the entire family would be laughing at them all</p>  <p id = > night. The thought of it gave Paula much pleasure. “No, we’re not,” Martha huffed. “You’re not? That won’t do. Even if you’re mad at Dad, Martha, you can't skip his birthday party. He really misses you these days, he keeps talking about you.” Paula grew anxious once she heard that her sister was not going home. She was waiting for the day Martha and the Johnstons embarrassed themselves in front of the entire family. However… Just then, a calm voice interrupted them unexpectedly. “We’ll be there, Aunt Paula.</p>  <p id = > Mom was only kidding,” Philip suddenly said with a chuckle.</p>  <h2 id =chapter-112 > Chapter 112</h2>  <p id = > Philip’s voice was not loud. He smiled at them apologetically. Even so, his words left everyone in the room stunned. Martha especially looked at him like he was a ghost. She felt terrible all over, and she burst out swearing,</p>  <p id = > “Damn you, Philip, no one asked you! Get the hell out!” Martha was beside herself with fury. Philip was such a blabbermouth. “Compare yourself to Paula’s son-in-law! Do you think you have any right to speak?” Martha roared at Philip furiously. “If you weren’t so useless, would I embarrass myself in front of my family like this? I must have been blind to accept a useless piece of trash like you as my son-in-law back then! “Look at her son-in-law, look what he bought for her! What about you? Have you ever bought me anything? How can you say such nonsense on top of that? If you want to go to the party, you can go by yourself! I’m not going!” As Martha howled at him, Philip lowered his head helplessly. It seemed his mother-in-law was dead certain that he was a good-for-nothing now. Next to them, Paula enjoyed the show, chuckling to herself coldly. The irony on her face intensified. She pretended to say kindly, “Come on, Martha, don’t keep venting your temper on poor Philip like that. You know what they say, a girl is only as good as the man she marries. It’s not Philip’s fault, it’s Wynn’s fault for choosing the wrong man.” She turned the blame to Wynn. Aunt Paula was quite the masterful character in her own right. She was blatantly picking a fight here. Martha only grew angrier when she heard that. What</p>  <p id = > happened three years ago was already enough to make her lose all face in front of her family. Now that she thought about it, it was her daughter who insisted on marrying Philip Clarke, by hook or by crook. In the end, he turned out to be absolutely worthless, after all. “It’s all your fault, stupid girl. You just had to insist on marrying this useless piece of trash! See what you’ve done? I don’t even dare to go home now because of you.” Martha screamed like a banshee, her temper boiling over. “I don’t care. If you still think of me as your mother, I want you to divorce this useless Philip right now! It’s either him or me!” “Mom, could you not? Why do you have to keep bringing up the past?” Wynn felt pretty upset too. It was humiliating for her to have her mother talk to her like that, especially in front of Aunt Paula and Juan. “Sorry, Juan. Do you maybe want to go back first?” Wynn turned to Juan with a sheepish smile. Juan nodded too and left the room.</p>  <p id = > True, it was kind of awkward. After all, he was still an outsider here. Before he left, though, he glanced at Philip who was standing in the corner quietly.</p>  <p id = > Juan gave Philip a taunting look. The genius Philip Clarke who ruled the school back then had now fallen to such an extent. It was quite hard to imagine, really. Since Wynn did not agree to divorce Philip, Martha threw everything out the window and plopped her behind on the floor, throwing a tantrum as she wailed, “You heartless little witch! Your father and I raised you all those years, and this is how you treat us? Why did you marry that useless thing? What did I do wrong in my past life to deserve a heartless daughter like you?” Wynn felt bad seeing Martha roll around screaming on the floor too, so she hurriedly tried to help her mother up. However, Martha simply refused to get up. She just pointed at Philip and wailed like she was at a funeral. There was nothing Wynn could do, so she just gave up. “Mom, I won’t divorce Philip.” “You’ve gone mad, Wynn! Do you really want to spend the rest of your life with that piece of trash?” The way Martha saw it, someone as hopeless as Philip should never have married her daughter. If she had insisted back then and stopped them from getting married, if she had found Wynn a good man instead, then she would be living the good life</p>  <p id = > in a bungalow just like her sister right now. “No, Mom. Although Philip lost his business these past three years and ended up poor, although life has been hard for us, he still never once complained over the past three years. He treats me very well, too. No matter what, I won’t divorce him.” Wynn made her stand clear and stole a glance at Philip. However, she saw that Philip was actually smiling at her stupidly. Seriously! Could he not see that her mother was really unhappy with him? How could he still smile so stupidly like that? This entire time, Wynn had been on her last bit of patience with Philip. She really thought she would divorce him. When that incident happened out of the blue that day, though, and when she suddenly saw that video today, Wynn realized that she still cared about Philip. He still had an important place in her heart. “Philip, you told me that I just have to wait one more year, and you’ll give me a future brighter than I ever dreamed. Were you telling the truth?” “I was.” “I don’t want to see people calling you names all the time. I don’t want you to become a laughing stock. I want all the people who looked down on you to regret it. Can you do that?” Wynn’s eyes were red as she stared intently at Philip. “I can.” Philip gave her a simple answer, turned, and left. From the very beginning until now, Wynn had only ever been concerned about him, and not about herself.</p>    <h2 id =chapter-113 > Chapter 113</h2>  <p id = > Behind him, Martha roared, “If you leave now, Philip Clarke, don’t ever come back! What’s a useless piece of trash like you pretending to be all capable?” However, Philip simply ignored her. He made Wynn a promise, and he was going to keep it. As soon as he walked out of the hospital door, he was given a jolt by the honk from a car horn. It was a BMW X8, top of the line. Juan sat in the car, his expression cool and arrogant. Philip frowned slightly and walked over to him, asking him coldly, “What do you want?”</p>  <p id = > Juan got out of the car and took off his sunglasses, putting them in his front</p>  <p id = > shirt pocket. “Pfft,” he said with a laugh. “I was so embarrassed for you in the room just now. How did you manage to hold on for so long?” So he was only here to jeer at Philip. Philip could not be bothered to entertain him, so he just turned to leave. However, Juan stood in his way, taunting Philip.</p>  <p id = > “It’s been three years, Philip. What have you given Wynn? Let go, and give her a divorce. I’ll show her a better future.” Juan utterly and totally looked down on Philip. The latter was just too useless. To his surprise, though, Philip said coolly, “Do you think you’re all that well-to-do, Juan? Do you really think Wynn will be happy with you?” Juan gave an icy laugh. “At least I can earn a few tens of millions every year. What about you? You’re nothing but a pathetic delivery boy, earning pennies every month. What can you give Wynn? What can you give Mila? Can you afford a surgery fee of a million bucks?” “Tens of millions?” Philip scoffed. “Juan, you’re nothing more than a pathetic joke in my eyes. I advise you not to provoke me, and stop aiming for Wynn. Otherwise, I’ll make you regret it!” Juan paused and then burst out laughing. “Do you have any idea what you just said, Philip?</p>  <p id = > You’re going to make me regret it? You, the useless piece of trash?” Juan laughed. He had lost all faith in Philip after that foolish display. “You know, Philip, we used to be friends. Back in college, I thought you were like a blinding ray of light. Everyone idolized you. But now? Look at yourself.</p>  <p id = > What right do you have to say something like that to me? You’re going to make me regret it? Sure. Bring it on!” Juan challenged him. Philip clenched his hands into fists, holding himself back. However, Juan only went from bad to worse. He gave Philip a vicious shove and spat in his face, saying,</p>  <p id = > “You’re useless! I’m officially declaring to you here and now that I’m going all out in my efforts to win Wynn over! Let’s see you try and stop me!” With that, Juan sauntered his way back into the car. The brand new BMW X8</p>  <p id = > drove right past Philip and nearly knocked him over. As he watched Juan’s car leave, Philip took his phone out of his pocket and then wordlessly put it back in. This was the last chance he was giving Juan. The last chance. After that, Philip took a cab directly to Apex Tower. This time, the secretary took</p>  <p id = > him straight to the chairman’s lounge. After the previous incident, the company gave all the staff a special training session. Now almost everyone knew Philip, but at the same time, all of them kept it a secret. George Thomas entered the room, all smiles and perfectly respectful. “To what do I owe the pleasure of this visit, Young Master?” Philip stood in front of the floor-to-ceiling window, looking down on the streets of Riverdale. A thousand thoughts ran through his mind. “Wynn’s maternal grandfather is celebrating his seventieth birthday in a few days. Prepare me a suitable present,” Philip said. George immediately nodded. “Yes, sir.” Philip did not linger, heading right back to the hospital. By then, Martha and Paula had left. When he saw Wynn, he realized that she looked extremely anxious and unhappy. “What’s the matter, Wynn?” Philip asked. Wynn looked frustrated. She gave Philip a look and said, “Juan just called me. He said Professor Turner has another patient he needs to treat, so he can’t come check on Mila. We’ll have to wait another half a month.” So that was why she was so worried. “Wynn, do you want to know who Professor Turner’s other patient is?” Philip asked Wynn suddenly.</p>  <h2 id =chapter-114 > Chapter 114</h2>  <p id = > Wynn blinked. Philip said that as though he knew. How would Philip Clarke of all know who Professor Turner’s patient was? “Alright, I know you’re trying to make me feel better, but since Professor Turner isn’t free right now, we’ll just have to wait,” Wynn said with some impatience. However, Philip smiled and said, “Wynn, do you trust me?” Wynn looked at him suspiciously. It truly felt to her like he was slightly different today, as though he had a little more confidence than he did before. “You’re my husband. If I don’t trust you, who should I trust?” she said with a small smile. Well, that was what she said but it was actually just lip service. When it came to this matter, she trusted Juan a tad more. After all, Juan was rich, powerful, and well-connected. He was even the one who pleaded with Professor Turner to get Mila a fighting chance. Nevertheless, she did not want to hurt Philip by</p>  <p id = > saying that to his face, so she told him a little white lie. Philip was no fool, either. He knew what she was thinking. Holding her soft, small and delicate hand, he said gently, “Don’t worry, Wynn. I’ll contact Professor Turner.</p>  <p id = > Mila will be able to check into the hospital tomorrow, and she can have the surgery in a week from now.” A week from now? But Juan said that Professor Turner would be unavailable for the next half a month. Was Philip implying that Professor Turner was going to be spending that time on helping Mila? No way. Wynn gave him a faint smile. “Alright, Philip. I know you’re trying to comfort me, but this isn’t something we can force.</p>  <p id = > I’ll talk to Juan about the details. You should go back home and stay with Mila.” With that, Wynn lay in bed and turned to her side, putting her back against Philip. Philip looked at her back, but he did not continue trying to explain. Inwardly, he said to himself, “You’ll know next week, Wynn. Your husband is not a good-for-nothing at all.” After he left the hospital, Philip returned to the company. Agnes had been looking after Mila the entire time.</p>  <p id = > She was quite fond of kids and had a lot of fun playing with Mila. The vehicle the company gave delivery runners had all been changed to BMWs, and that made a large splash online. That meant Gopher Delivery Services was also trending right now. Countless netizens were trying to guess who the company’s owner was. They were being so flagrant with their money!</p>  <p id = > An entire fleet of BMW bikes! Only the filthiest of all rich people would do that! There were even reporters from various media outlets camped outside the company doors, behaving almost like paparazzi. Thankfully, Philip was very plain-looking. Even when he walked right past their noses, they would never have guessed that he was the owner of this company. After he spent some time with Mila, he left the company once more. It was because he had received a call from Henry Turner offering to treat him to a meal. George Thomas would be joining too. Philip gave it some thought and decided to attend after all. The location was set at Virtuous Court. When Philip arrived, the room they had booked, Zenith Hall, was already filled with more than ten people. “Mr. Clarke.” Henry immediately stood up and greeted Philip</p>  <p id = > with a respectful smile. The people in the room were mostly the students and specialists Henry had brought with him. All of them were also secretly surprised to see their teacher, the internationally-renowned medical expert, treat such an average-looking young man with such respect. They had long since heard that Professor Turner came here to Riverdale specifically for a certain man. They just did not think that he would be so young. That probably meant he had quite the impressive background, huh? “You don’t need to be formal, Professor Turner. You’re my elder and a legend in the medical world, after all. Please, don’t be so polite with me.” Philip smiled and returned a polite bow. The two of them took their seats, with George Thomas accompanying them. After a few toasts, Henry went straight to the point. “Mr. Clarke, Turner's Hospital would like to start a research division here in Riverdale. I hope I can count on your support in this endeavor.” He wanted Philip’s help and not just an investment. With Philip’s support, Turner's Hospital would definitely be able to start their Riverdale division.</p>  <p id = > After all, Turner's Hospital was quite capable in themselves. Every other city would be clamoring for their presence on their grounds. Philip was different, however. His background was another story altogether. Henry Turner knew that very well. As long as he could get Philip on board as an investor, the future of Turner's Hospital would surely go beyond domestic borders. Besides, Turner's Hospital needed funds for their research too. The size of the funding they needed was no joke. Naturally, that was Henry’s final goal in all this. Philip said calmly, “You can just talk to old George about this. However much money you need, just ask him and he’ll give it to you.” The moment Henry heard that, he immediately beamed brightly and held up his glass. “My appreciation goes beyond a mere thanks, Mr. Clarke.</p>  <p id = > On behalf of all the doctors in the country, I toast to your generous contribution.” With that, Henry drained the glass.</p>  <h2 id =chapter-115 > Chapter 115</h2>  <p id = > They needed at least two billion in investments this time! Henry could afford that much himself, but he could not possibly contribute so much at once. He would require approval and red tape from all parties. That was why the medical developments in the country could not keep up with those from overseas. Now that Mr. Clarke had agreed to invest that amount, though, that would speed up domestic research by at least five years! Five whole years! That would take so much blood, sweat, and tears from so many diligent medical personnel. Henry Turner knew very well how much every medical researcher toiled away behind the scenes, doing what looked like mundane and meaningless experiments. That was why he was so grateful.</p>  <p id = > It was not just him, either. His students in the room were extremely excited too. They knew that their teacher had brought them here and treated this man to a meal for a reason. They needed to find someone who was willing to donate two billion. That was not a small sum by any means. Who would ever want to invest in a medical project that could go five or even ten years without a tangible result? Everyone was getting emotional, and they all cheered to Philip’s health. It took a while before Henry finally calmed down.</p>  <p id = > He ventured carefully, “Mr. Clarke, we need an astronomical amount of funding this time. Are you sure you’re willing to invest in us?” It was not that Henry did not trust Philip. He was just being very cautious. He did not want to see a ray of hope, only to have it dashed once more. “How much money do you need?” Philip asked calmly. Henry said with some difficulty,</p>  <p id = > “Two billion. Also, we might not be able to give you a return on your investment within five to ten years.” His heart was pounding. It was only his initial celebration that he remembered just how enormous a sum two billion was. The way Philip’s expression changed slightly when he heard that amount made Henry’s heart skip a beat too. “I’ll give you four billion, but on one condition. Turner’s Hospital’s Riverdale branch must only have a contract with Beacon Pharmaceutical, and you must work with Wynn Johnston, an employee there.” Philip suddenly said, completely composed.</p>  <p id = > At that moment, everyone in the room was stunned! Only George Thomas</p>  <p id = > stayed calmly drinking his tea without a word at the side. Four billion really was not that much. Back then, when the young master built a national statue of Confucious on Mount Fuji, he spent almost ten billion on it! All so he could give them the finger! He could not allow others to bully his country, Orienta! Although a hundred years had passed since then, he still made sure to pay the oppressors back for their humiliation of his country. Henry was so shocked that his hands were shaking. Hot tears filled his eyes and he said excitedly, “You’re amazing, Mr. Clarke! I accept your condition, no problem! On behalf of medical workers everywhere, I thank you with all my heart. Please… Please accept my toast!” Henry Turner was already old and gray, but right here and now, his blood was rushing through his veins.</p>  <p id = > This was such a boon for the domestic medical scene! An unimaginable boon, the likes he never dared to dream of! All the doctors in the room had all jumped to their feet and respectfully raised their glasses at Philip. Philip did not act lofty, either. He said calmly, “There’s no need to go that far, everyone. I’m just doing what I can for the local medical scene. Right now, the bigger countries are dominating the area and limiting our access to medical technology, refusing to share their knowledge with us. I’ve gotten quite sick of that. All I ask is that all of you can dedicate your minds to your research and come up with the best results, so that we can slap those foreigners in the face with what we can do. Show them they can’t look down on Orienta!” The applause was rapturous. After everyone had their fill of food and wine, they decided to leave soon. Philip visited the washroom, but an unfortunate coincidence awaited him when he passed by the main hall.</p>  <p id = > A voice called out to him loudly from behind. “Philip Clarke? What are you doing here, you broke hobo?” The voice was taunting, filled with arrogance and contempt. Philip frowned slightly and turned to see Aiden Grant, who was walking out of the hall. He was wearing a deep-green suit and dressed to the nines, looking like the very embodiment of success. Aiden was in a bad mood these past few days. It all started with the terrible embarrassment he suffered after the previous incident. He had been looking for a way to get</p>  <p id = > back at Philip all this time. Today, lo and behold, he bumped into Philip at Virtuous Court. Even the heavens were helping him. Philip could not be bothered to deal with him, that self-absorbed narcissist. That was why Philip simply turned to leave. However, there was no way Aiden was going to let this chance go. He directly stood in Philip’s way, sneering at him. “Well, well, Philip Clarke. Can’t even be bothered to look at me anymore, huh?</p>  <p id = > How could a broke beggar like you warrant a meal at Virtuous Court? Don’t you know the clientele here consists of the best of society? “Wait a sec!</p>  <p id = > Hey, are you here working part-time to earn Mila’s medical fee?” All of a sudden, something occurred to Aiden and he burst out laughing, the contempt in his eyes intensifying. How could someone like this end up marrying Wynn? Philip looked at Aiden coldly. “Whatever I’m doing here, it’s none of your business.” Aiden blinked, and then his expression turned stormy. He swore, “F*ck you! How dare a useless piece of trash like you talk to me like that!” Philip’s frown deepened. Should he punish Aiden Grant? Just then, Aiden jeered at him coldly again and said, “Philip, who do you think invited me here today?”</p>  <h2 id =chapter-116 > Chapter 116</h2>  <p id = > Philip frowned deeply, frost in his eyes. Aiden patted Philip’s shoulder proudly and said, “I bet you’ll never guess this. It’s already this late in the night, and yet Wynn suddenly invited me to meet here!” Hahaha! That felt amazing! Aiden was ecstatic to see just how ugly Philip’s complexion would turn! Any man would fly off the handle to hear that his wife was meeting another man this late at night. However, Philip just smiled calmly and said, “Oh, and your point is?” He was cool and collected, as though it did not concern him at all. Aiden felt like he was getting an aneurysm. How could Philip stand something like that? “What the f*ck, Clarke! Your wife is secretly meeting me, so why aren’t you mad at all? Don’t you think we might do something a little more after dinner? Aren’t you worried?” Aiden’s words were like arrows shot to the heart. Any normal man would be raring</p>  <p id = > for a fight after that. However, Philip was different. He trusted Wynn, wholly and unconditionally. That was why he would not entertain those possibilities no matter what Aiden said. Well, that did not mean he necessarily liked what he was hearing, of course. Even so, Philip did not show his displeasure. Instead, he kept his cool. If even Philip lost faith in Wynn, his wife, then that would be a true tragedy. “There’s nothing for me to worry about. After all, Wynn already told me about it,” Philip said casually. Aiden blinked, his look of jest suddenly freezing on his face.</p>  <p id = > Goddamnit! He thought he finally had a chance to insult Philip, but the latter was completely unaffected. He did not seem angry at all. That had to be a ruse. Philip must be pretending! That was why Aiden said crossly, “Why put on a cool mask like that, trash? You’re a piece of trash so low that you can’t even keep an eye on your wife, so why bother acting cool with me?</p>  <p id = > Do you really think I won’t be able to take Wynn home with me tonight?”</p>  <p id = > He even chuckled coldly before he continued, “I’ll be honest with you, then.</p>  <p id = > Wynn wants to meet me to ask me for money. She wants an entire million!</p>  <p id = > Don’t you think I should ask her for something in return for that much money?” Aiden’s face said exactly what he meant by “something”. It was repulsive and despicable. Philip clenched his hands into fists, his eyes going cold. Bam! It all happened without warning! He slammed his fist right into Aiden’s face, and blood started spurting from the latter’s nose! “I’m warning you, Aiden Grant! Don’t mess with me, or I’ll make you regret it for the rest of your life!” Philip said furiously, bloodlust in his eyes. “F*ck!” Aiden bent over, holding his nose. His face was twitching as he jabbed a finger at Philip, roaring, “How dare you hit me, Clarke! Motherf*cker, you’re dead meat today!” As he said that, he hurriedly pulled out his phone and made a call.</p>  <p id = > His voice was muffled as he held his nose. “Dan, f*cking get your *ss to Virtuous Court! There’s someone I need you to kill!” With that, he hung up and looked at Philip with fire in his eyes. He was definitely furious now.</p>  <p id = > How dare a wimp like that attack him! He was going to teach Philip a lesson he would never forget today! That would show him for messing with</p>  <p id = > someone he should not! However, Philip watched everything unfold calmly.</p>  <p id = > He already had a plan in mind. He had to finish off Aiden Grant, once and for all! The man had crossed Philip’s bottom line. It did not matter if Aiden owned some large education company chain, or if his father knew the minister of education. Anyone who tried to stop him from taking Aiden down would go down as well! With that decision made, Philip took one step forward and stared at Aiden icily. “Grant, you’ve successfully managed to piss me off. In that case, prepare to face the consequences. “Haha.” Aiden chuckled coldly and pulled out a napkin to cover his nose. His gaze was sharp but his voice was still muffled as he said, “What? A piece of trash like you wants to make me pay?” What a joke! Philip was a good-for-nothing broke-*ss beggar! Yet he was threatening Aiden now? He must have a death wish! The corners of Philip’s lips curved into a cold sneer, and he mouthed,</p>  <p id = > “Idiot.” Then he raised his fists again and swung them at Aiden once more.</p>  <p id = > Aiden’s eyes instantly widened in shock, and he hurriedly covered his face with his hands. He usually acted pompously, but he was actually half a head shorter than Philip and far less fit. “Stop!” All of a sudden… An angry shout reached them from not too far away.</p>  <h2 id =chapter-117 > Chapter 117</h2>  <p id = > A slender figure immediately walked up to them. Slap! There was the crisp sound of an unhesitating slap, hitting Philip right across the face. The pain was instant and unbearable. Wynn's face was flushed red with fury. She glared at Philip, yelling, \"What on earth were you trying to do, Philip Clarke?!\" The first thing she saw as soon as she walked through the door was Philip about to punch Aiden. Of course Wynn was furious! She had invited Aiden out here today so she could borrow one million from him for Mila's surgery fee. If they made an enemy out of Aiden now, where else was she going to find the money? Her parents had left them completely out to dry. They told her in no uncertain terms that they would not give her a single cent unless she divorced Philip. That was why Wynn had no other choice.</p>  <p id = > The only people she could think of were Juan and Aiden. She glared at Philip and then turned around. When she saw that Aiden's nose was bleeding, her anger only intensified. She hastened to apologize to Aiden.</p>  <p id = > \"A… Aiden, are you okay? I'm so, so sorry. I apologize on Philip's behalf, alright? Come on, let me take you to the hospital to get that checked out. If there's anything, I'll take full responsibility.\" Looking at how bad Aiden's injury was, Wynn practically hated Philip's guts now. Aiden was not going to hold it against Wynn, of course, but he could hold Philip accountable, right? So he immediately hardened his expression and pointed a finger at Philip. \"It doesn't matter how you apologize to me, Wynn. I have to hear his apology! If he doesn't say sorry for what he did, I won't stop until he does!\"</p>  <p id = > When Wynn heard that, she instantly panicked. She hurriedly berated Philip, saying, \"Go on, Philip! Hurry up and apologize to Aiden!\" Philip's expression was dark, his eyes cold as he stared at Aiden. He saw how cocky and taunting Aiden's gaze was right now. No, Philip could not bring himself to apologize to this despicable man. After all, Aiden had crossed his bottom line. That was why Philip kept his face cold as he said, \"I won't apologize to him.\" That was enough to send Wynn into a tizzy. Behind her, Aiden immediately chuckled icily. \"Hmph-hmph… Very well! Just you wait, Philip! If you have the balls, just you stay right there!\" So Philip was putting on a brave face, huh? Sure! Aiden wanted to see how long he could keep that up! The atmosphere was ice-cold. Wynn kept apologizing to Aiden, but the latter only had one request. He wanted an apology from Philip. Wynn even got into a huge argument with Philip over it. She wanted him to apologize, but he simply refused. Usually, Philip would do whatever Wynn asked, but today was different. He had made up his mind. Aiden Grant and his family were done for! Wynn was on the verge of tears by now. Just then, a few beefy gangsters barged through the doors of Virtuous Court. All of them had tattoos, and their hairstyles varied from skinhead, flattop, crew cut, to something multi-colored. They were really f*cking fashionable. The skinhead in charge was a thug who was well-known in these parts, Big Dan.</p>  <p id = > Everyone down there knew about Dan’s temper and tendency for violence.</p>  <p id = > He was the type of character who regularly had supper in detention centers.</p>  <p id = > As soon as he walked in, he brought his men to Aiden, roaring at the top of his lungs, “Yo, what’s the rush, Mr. Grant? Me and the boys were bathing our feet.” Aiden cut the chase too. He immediately sneered coldly and pointed at Philip, “Why are you even asking? Can’t you see I’ve been assaulted? That’s the guy, get him!” Dan flew off the handle the moment he saw how Aiden looked. Jabbing a finger at Philip, he bellowed, “Are you the one behind that, punk?” With an angry roar, the thugs Dan had brought with him instantly surrounded Philip. All of them looked out to kill. Wynn was terrified. She tugged at Aiden’s hand and pleaded with him. “Come on, Aiden, let’s not do that. I apologize to you on Philip’s behalf, alright?”</p>  <p id = > Aiden shook his head. “I don’t want to put you in a rough spot, Wynn, but I can’t just let this slide today.” Wynn was losing her mind now. Finally, she clenched her teeth and said, “Aiden, if you just let Philip go, I’ll do anything you ask me to. Just once.” Anything he asked her to? Aiden’s face immediately broke into a grin. Philip frowned deeply when he heard that.</p>  <p id = > “There’s no need for that, Wynn. Aiden Grant can’t touch me.” Philip was telling the truth. However, there was no way Wynn would believe him. She turned around, her eyes red, and she shrieked at Philip, “Shut the hell up!”</p>  <p id = > Aiden instantly laughed coldly. “Sure! Just have this meal with me and follow me back to a hotel. If you do that, I’ll let him go and lend you a million bucks.” His true intentions were now clear for all to see. Wynn’s gaze hardened. She did not expect him to ask for something so unreasonable! “Do it!” When Aiden saw her hesitate, he simply gave the order, trying to force her to agree. Wynn panicked and was about to say yes, when… Suddenly, there was a furious yell from the other end! “All of you, stop this at once!” Javier Morris ran up to them with a team of a dozen security guards behind him. Earlier, he heard the receptionist say that there was a fight breaking out in the lobby, and blood had even been shed. That was why he came running. From the distance, though, he then saw that it</p>  <p id = > was Mr. Clarke being surrounded by thugs! How could he not panic? He hastily jogged over and bent his waist into a respectful bow. “Sorry for the scare, Mr. Clarke. Please leave the rest to me.” Just the way he said Mr.</p>  <p id = > Clarke was enough to leave most people at the scene stunned! Wynn’s heart skipped a beat at the sudden turn of events. Mr. Clarke?</p>  <h2 id =chapter-118 > Chapter 118</h2>  <p id = > Wynn was shocked somewhat out of her wits. Why would they call Philip…</p>  <p id = > Mr. Clarke? Wait! This man… This man was the owner of Virtuous Court, Javier Morris! He had personally attended Wynn’s father’s birthday party last time, bringing with him good wine and even a platinum membership card! Besides, Wynn clearly remembered that he had mentioned Mr. Clarke last time too. Back then, everyone was looking down on Philip, so naturally they would never associate that name with him. Only Wynn paid a little extra attention to that, though soon she too forgot about that as well. Now, though… Right here and now... Javier had approached them once again.</p>  <p id = > This time, he was respectfully calling her husband Mr. Clarke! No matter how ignorant Wynn might be, by now she would have started to piece some things together. So that night, Javier had given her father that gift in Philip’s stead, huh? It went without saying that Philip noticed the gears turning in Wynn’s head. Crap. She must be onto something now. That was why he gave Javier a cold glare. Just one look was enough to scare Javier speechless. What the heck? Did I end up offending Mr. Clarke? Javier was so terrified that his legs shook. Ignoring Aiden, who was still yelling his head off, Philip walked up to a clearly disorientated Wynn. She even took a few steps back, retreating away from him in alarm. “Wynn, I’ll answer any questions you might have later, okay? For now, could you wait for me outside?” Wynn frowned her beautiful brows, looking at Philip in confusion. She then glanced at Aiden and Javier, finally nodding without a word and stumbling out of the lobby, still somewhat dazed. Before she left, she turned around once to look at Philip. He was still wearing that gentle</p>  <p id = > smile she knew so well. That put her heart somewhat at ease. No matter what, he was still Philip Clarke. Philip heaved a sigh of relief when he saw Wynn leave through the door. His mind was running a mile a minute as he wondered how he should explain this to Wynn and try to pull the wool over her eyes. Well, if he really could not keep it under wraps anymore, should he consider telling her the truth? Perhaps he could give her some hints as to his true identity and see how she reacted. Having settled with that, Philip stopped worrying about it and turned to look at Aiden instead. The latter began to panic slightly when he saw Javier bring his guards to intervene.</p>  <p id = > The respectful way Javier treated that good-for-nothing Philip utterly puzzled him as well. Mr. Clarke? What kind of a ridiculous joke was this meant to be? He was just a useless piece of trash, a mere delivery man! What did he do to warrant being called Mr. Clarke? Had Javier Morris gone mad?!</p>  <p id = > “What do you mean by this, Mr. Morris?” Aiden did not dare to take liberties with Javier. Yes, Javier Morris was just the owner of a restaurant, but apparently he had a complicated network of connections supporting him.</p>  <p id = > There were even many rumors saying that he was related to an important figure in the province. That was why his restaurant had branches all across Riverfront Province. It was almost a monopoly! Javier’s background and resources alone warranted caution from Aiden. Hence, Aiden treated him relatively politely. Javier saw Philip frown, and the former immediately straightened up. He approached Aiden head-on and looked at him coldly, saying, “Mr. Grant, this here is my territory. Could you care to explain why you brought thugs here to start a riot?” Javier did not want to make an enemy out of Aiden either. Aiden had a rich and powerful father, and offending him would not do Javier any good. Aiden chuckled coldly. “Mr. Morris, are you trying to protect that idiot behind you?” Idiot? Smack! Javier simply slapped Aiden across the face! The slap was so sudden that it left Aiden completely confused. The blood started streaming from his nose once more!</p>  <p id = > “F*ck! Javier Morris, you’ve f*cking lost your mind!” Aiden roared, hurriedly holding his nose. All his life, Aiden had never suffered such a</p>  <p id = > beating. Did they have a grudge against his nose today? “Shut your mouth!</p>  <p id = > Aiden Grant, I’m warning you. Don’t be rude to Mr. Clarke. If you insist, even your father will have to apologize to Mr. Clarke when he gets here!”</p>  <p id = > Javier barked, ice in his eyes. Aiden instantly blew his top. He howled,</p>  <p id = > “Very well, Javier Morris! Let’s see who dares to stop me from getting rid of Philip Clarke today!” With a roar, Dan and his men stood off against Javier’s guards. The tension was palpable, like a fully-inflated balloon poised right on the tip of a needle. Just then, Philip stood up calmly and called a number. The voice on the other end was George Thomas’s, familiar and polite. “What can I do for you, Young Master?” “I’ll give you ten minutes. Take down Splendor Education Group and Aiden Grant’s Stardream Media,” Philip said calmly. On the other end, George immediately responded, “Yes, sir. I’ll get on it right away.”</p>  <h2 id =chapter-119 > Chapter 119</h2>  <p id = > He hung up. Aiden’s entire face was red from the laughter he was holding back. Soon, though, he burst out laughing with Dan and the others, pointing at Philip and taunting him, “Well, f*ck me sideways! Philip, are you a f*cking idiot? You want to destroy my dad’s company and mine in ten minutes? You?” Aiden was so angry that all he could do was laugh. Had Philip gone absolutely insane? However, Philip merely smiled calmly and said, “You’ll know soon enough.” At the same time, George was already getting to work on his end. It was ridiculously easy for him to take down Splendor Education Group and Stardream Media. He just had to dig up some dirt on them, right? Easy peasy. Soon enough, thanks to George’s machinations, he received files full of Splendor Education Group and Stardream Media’s dirtiest secrets. George just gave the information a glance before handing them to his subordinates for follow-up. After that, he picked up his phone and called his young master. “It’s all done, Young Master. You just have to turn on the television now if you want to see it.”</p>  <p id = > At the same time, Philip asked Javier to turn the TV behind the large</p>  <p id = > projector in the restaurant lobby to the news channels. Aiden did not quite understand what was happening here. However, he had a vague sixth sense that instilled in him a premonition of danger. Soon enough, he heard the hostess’s voice coming from the TV. “Breaking news, it has been reported that there was a child sexual assault case at Periwinkle Star Preschool, one of the local preschools under Splendor Education Group. The principal and other related persons-in-charge have been arrested. The police investigations are underway…” When they reported that piece of news, Aiden’s face turned green! How did this happen? Did they not shut down this incident a week ago? Why was it suddenly exposed now? It was even being reported on the largest news channel in Riverdale! Who was it? Who was f*cking out for his family’s company? Immediately after that…</p>  <p id = > “Breaking news! The chairman of Splendor Education Group, Gordon Grant, has tunneled funds multiple times. The police have already established a special investigation team to raid Splendor Education Group.</p>  <p id = > They will be looking into this thoroughly!” Boom! Aiden was so scared that his legs shook and he also lost his balance. His eyes were wide as he stared at the images on the screen. No way! His old man’s tunneling antics had been exposed too! They were seriously done for this time! Aiden was properly scared now. He immediately took out his phone and called his father. “Dad, what do we do? What should we do? It’s even on TV! Hurry up and figure something out, I don’t want to go to jail.” Gordon roared at him across the phone, “Aiden Grant! Who the f*ck did you offend?! You’ve destroyed our entire family! You’ve destroyed us! Do you understand?!”</p>  <p id = > Aiden was stunned, his brain buzzing. He instantly raised his head and looked at Philip. The latter looked calm and even wore a small smile.</p>  <p id = > Impossible. There was no way this was Philip’s doing. He was a useless piece of trash. He could never do something this considerable. “Dad, I… I don’t know either. I just… Philip Clarke, he…” Aiden was clearly panicked now, his words tumbling all over the place. Just then... “Breaking news, Stardream Media, founded by Aiden Grant, the son of Splendor Education</p>  <p id = > Group’s chairman, Gordon Grant, has been accused of having unspoken rules and casting couch antics. A combined special forces team has already arrested the related employees at the company, and they are now urgently seeking the CEO, Aiden Grant…” Smack! Aiden’s phone fell from his phone and onto the floor. When he heard that news, his brain simply stopped working. His knees gave way under him and he fell onto the floor, his eyes losing focus and his body trembling. It was over. It was all over. As for Dan and the others, they had made a run for it the moment they saw things going south. Philip looked down at Aiden coolly, saying, “I told you I’d make you regret it. A punishment of this extent is not unreasonable, is it? Spend the rest of your life making up for your sins in prison.” Aiden was terrified. He immediately pounced at Philip and hugged his leg, tears pouring down his face as he begged, “Brother Clarke, Brother Clarke! I’m begging you, spare me! I was wrong, I’m sorry, I really am! I won’t do anything like that again!</p>  <p id = > Please, spare me! I don’t want to be arrested, I don’t want to go to jail. Just spare me and I’ll do anything.” As he said that, Aiden fell to his knees and kowtowed repeatedly, knocking his head against the floor until it bled! In the face of Aiden’s howls and pleas, Philip simply walked past him perfectly calmly. Javier later called the police. Within ten minutes, Aiden was escorted out of the back door and into the police car. Philip did not feel an ounce of mercy when he saw Aiden being taken away. Aiden deserved every bit of this. Outside the door, Wynn had been waiting in the cold wind for more than ten minutes. She was worried about Philip, her heart racing for some reason. When Wynn saw Philip walking out of the restaurant safely in one piece, she immediately pounced at Philip and threw her arms around him, hugging him tightly. “Thank goodness you’re okay.” Philip blinked, and then the corners of his lips rose. He patted her back and said, “I’m fine.”</p>  <p id = > Wynn let go of him and gave him an angry look. “Where’s Aiden? How did you settle your fight? Also, why did Mr. Morris call you Mr. Clarke? He was the one who gave my dad that good wine and membership card. Was the Mr. Clarke he mentioned back then you?” Wynn asked several questions</p>  <p id = > in close succession, the desire in her eyes burning strongly. Was it him?</p>  <p id = > Philip paused for a moment, patting her head and saying with a gentle smile,</p>  <p id = > “Wynn, you always wanted to know what my parents do, right? What my family used to do? I’ll tell you right now.”</p>  <h2 id =chapter-120 > Chapter 120</h2>  <p id = > Wynn’s eyes widened. They had been married for so long, but even now she did not know about Philip’s past. His parents did not even congratulate them in person at their wedding. Wynn had asked him many times before this, but he had glossed over the question every time. After a long time, Wynn began to assume that Philip was an orphan who did not want to relive his painful past, so she stopped asking. However, the way Philip held himself today, his methods or rather his attitude, all of it was vastly different from the mild-mannered wimp he had always been before. He had changed. All of a sudden, she could not quite recognize him anymore. Even so, Wynn could tell that his love for her was sincere. “Are you finally willing to tell me?”</p>  <p id = > Wynn asked uncertainly. Philip nodded and looked up at the deep sky.</p>  <p id = > Keeping a completely straight face, he said, “Actually, Wynn, my family is quite wealthy. I never told you because I had a huge fight with my parents and ran away from home.” “You ran away from home?” Wynn blinked. She clearly never expected that to be Philip’s explanation. Even if he ran away from home, would he go as far as to not go home for years, not even for a visit? Would his parents not look for him? If that was the case, that must mean his parents were quite cold-blooded. Philip nodded. “My parents are rather conservative and traditional in their ways. At home, their word is law.</p>  <p id = > I ran away from home because they… arranged a marriage for me. I suppose it was for their business benefits. I had never even met that girl before, so on the day of my supposed engagement, I just ran away and came here.”</p>  <p id = > Philip did not tell Wynn everything. He just told her a summary, and he mixed a few lies into his story too. Philip could not tell her his entire true history yet. All he could do was give her a hint here and there. He would</p>  <p id = > take it slow. Starting from now, he could gradually begin to tell her the whole truth about his background. Wynn listened carefully, building a vague image of Philip’s family in her mind. It was conservative and even arranged a marriage for him. No wonder he ran away from home. “So your parents… I mean, our parents never came to look for you?” Wynn asked. If she remembered correctly, it had been seven years since Philip came to Riverdale. He had not left the city at all the past seven years. Had his parents never come to visit him? “They did look for me, but our negotiations failed.</p>  <p id = > My father lost his temper and disowned me,” Philip said calmly. They disowned him?! Shocked, Wynn covered her little mouth with her hand. She stared at him with wide eyes, her heart aching for him. “Philip, if you ask me, they’re still your parents, after all. You should think of a way to sit with them and talk it over. It’s been seven years, after all. You’re father and son, so you should be able to talk it out,” Wynn took Philip’s hand and tried to advise him after some thought. Philip heaved a sigh of relief, curling around his finger a lock of Wynn’s hair that had fallen across her forehead. “Alright, if you say so. I’ll contact them if I have the time.” “Okay!” Wynn nodded, her eyes curving into crescents as she gave him a sweet and innocent smile.</p>  <p id = > After that, she lowered her head and asked a question, shyly and timidly,</p>  <p id = > “Um, do Mom and Dad know about Mila and me?” Philip blinked and then said with a smile, “They know. Wait a while longer, and then I’ll take you and Mila back home for a talk. I think they’ll be quite happy to meet you and Mila.” “Really?” Wynn’s eyes widened and sparkled. Every woman wanted to be liked by her in-laws. “Oh yeah, don’t you want to know how much money my family has?” Philip suddenly found his mischievous streak.</p>  <p id = > He narrowed his eyes and asked her with a bright smile. Wynn pouted and went with it. “How much?” Philip mused for a second before saying,</p>  <p id = > “Slightly more than Aiden’s.” He did that on purpose. He just wanted to tell Wynn that Aiden was never more than a speck of dust in his eyes. Aiden earned tens of millions every year. If Philip had slightly more than Aiden, did that not mean… Wynn’s eyes glazed over, and then she stared at Philip</p>  <p id = > intently. Grabbing his arm tightly, she asked, “So you mean, Mila’s surgery fee…” Was Philip really that wealthy? Philip hugged Wynn tightly and comforted her, “Don’t worry, Wynn. Mila is my daughter. Of course I won’t let her suffer. Don’t worry about the surgery fee, I’ll handle that.” “Mm-hmm.” Wynn nodded, her face flooded with tears.</p>  <h2 id =chapter-121 > Chapter 121</h2>  <p id = > All the wrongs and pressure she had suffered these past few days made her collapse in an instant. It was all so much for her that she hammered his chest with her little fists, berating him softly, “It’s all your fault. Why didn’t you tell me earlier? I went begging and pleading everywhere. Don’t you know I never begged anyone for anything before? Sob…” Wynn cried her heart out.</p>  <p id = > Philip hugged her even more tightly. “Sorry, Wynn, it was my fault. I promised you that I would give you and Mila a bright future. Please believe me.” More than five minutes passed like that before Wynn’s emotions finally settled down. After that, she asked Philip worriedly, her eyes red,</p>  <p id = > “Since you got into such a huge fight with your parents, do you still have enough money to pay for Mila’s surgery?” Philip was a little awkward and sheepish as he said, “Actually, I have a card. It probably has a couple million in there. I never took it out before because I didn’t want to scare you. You don’t have to worry about anything now, I’ll handle everything.” Wynn nodded forcefully and did not ask anymore. She knew that there had to be a reason why Philip kept all this from her for so many years, only to tell her so much today. Philip was quite stubborn and had his ego. She had known that since she first met him. Over the past three years, he went from a proud, stubborn man to someone who was willing to toil and take insults. He had been tolerating so much for so long, so he must be exhausted and covered with scars. To be honest, Wynn was quite nervous to find out so much all at once. She could not be certain about anything, but she was willing to believe Philip. At least now she knew that he was not a good-for-nothing, after all.</p>  <p id = > Tonight, Philip had told a lie, a little half-lie. He lay on the floor, looking at</p>  <p id = > Wynn’s slender back and Mila’s adorable face as they slept on the bed.</p>  <p id = > Philip’s heart was still in turmoil. How was he supposed to keep up this lie now? What a pain. ‘Wynn, you might not know this, but your husband’s family is more than a little richer than the Grants.’ No one in the world, not a single family anywhere was wealthier than Philip. Whatever, he would just have to take it one step at a time. The next morning, in the washroom, Philip looked at Wynn and asked somewhat worriedly, “Do you want to go back to the hospital today? You’ve barely been hospitalized for a couple days.” Wynn smiled calmly and said, “It’s alright. Why waste all that money? Hurry up and feed Mila her food. My parents want us to go back for a visit today. They probably need to see us for something.” Philip did not say anything more. He had already contacted Henry Turner to handle Mila’s hospitalization that afternoon. When they arrived at his in-laws'</p>  <p id = > place, Philip could sense that the atmosphere in the home was heavy from the moment he stepped through the door. Martha and Charles were sitting on the couch, the household register booklet resting on the coffee table. Both of them had hard expressions on their faces. “Oh, you’re back now? Alright, come with me to the Municipal Civil Administration Bureau so we can get things done.” Martha’s face was frosty. She gave Philip and Mila, who he was holding, a vicious glare, muttering, “You brought that little b*stard home again too. Gah, what bad luck.” Martha had been in a bad mood since yesterday, and she had not gotten a wink of sleep last night. All she could think of was how to get Wynn to divorce Philip. Philip heard Martha’s murmur, and his expression turned cold too. In his arms, Mila hugged his neck tightly, her large eyes shining with fear. Wynn pitched in exasperatedly, “What are you doing now, Mom? If you’re just here to ask me to divorce Philip, we can leave right now.” With that, Wynn put her shoes back on and prepared to leave. She knew exactly what her mother was like. Martha could not go a day without drama. Martha instantly grew livid at those words. She roared, “Wynn Johnston, if you dare to walk out of this door today, you can forget about calling me your mother! Our household</p>  <p id = > register is right here. If you don’t get that divorce, I’ll cross you off our register! Your father and I will disown you!” Martha was furious. Why was her daughter such a fool? Did she really want to spend the rest of her life with this worthless wretch? Wynn’s temper was running very high too. Why did her mother insist on being so unreasonable? She gave Philip a complicated look. She had been trying to believe Philip since he told her all that last night. “Mom, why are you so against Philip? Is it because he’s poor?” Wynn asked. Martha was so angry that her face was flushed red.</p>  <p id = > Pointing a finger at him, she swore, “That’s right! If he was rich, I’d treat him better than if he was my own son. Unfortunately, he’s a good-for-nothing piece of trash! Didn’t you see how your Aunt Paula looked at us yesterday? Don’t you know how humiliated I am? “Wynn, you’re not a little girl anymore. Can’t you listen to your father and me? We didn’t manage to persuade you, and that’s why you ended up marrying this piece of scum.</p>  <p id = > But today, we won’t stop until you get a divorce.” As Martha said that, she gave Charles a harsh glare. Charles did not actually want to get involved in this, but he added a few helpless words, “Wynn, hurry up and get it done.</p>  <p id = > Don’t anger your mother anymore. If you get that divorce, I’ll give you five hundred thousand for Mila’s surgery.” Just then, Philip stood up and told Martha calmly, “Mom, Dad, we won’t get a divorce. We don’t need your five hundred thousand, either. I can afford Mila’s surgery fee.”</p>  <h2 id =chapter-122 > Chapter 122</h2>  <p id = > Martha was beyond furious! ‘This good-for-nothing thinks that he can afford it? Does he think that he has the money? At this point in time, this useless piece of trash is still holding on to his ego shamelessly.’ Martha glared at Philip impatiently and said with a mocking sneer, \"Philip, what did you just say? You don't want our family's 500,000 dollars and can afford it yourself? Okay, okay, so you're a big shot now? You think you’re too good for the Johnston family. Great, then you can divorce Wynn as soon as possible. My daughter is so beautiful, so she can easily marry into a wealthy</p>  <p id = > family in the future!\" Philip had a sullen expression. He said helplessly,</p>  <p id = > \"Mom, I actually have...\" \"What do you have? You want to say that you are loaded?\" Martha sneered disdainfully, then pointed at him before saying to Mila arrogantly, \"If it weren't for you two, Wynn wouldn’t have to suffer so much. I wouldn’t be in a situation where I can't hold my head up high in front of my side of the family. Stop bullshitting. The Johnston family no longer welcomes you. Leave now and bring this b*stard child with you.\"</p>  <p id = > Since Wynn married Philip, Martha had never been the least bit kind to Philip. It became worse when Philip failed to start his own business and accumulated debt. Philip was at her beck and call, but she always gave him an attitude. Moreover, because Philip and Wynn had a shotgun marriage, Martha was bitterly humiliated by her family. Her father's attitude toward her plummeted as well. For that reason, Martha began to hold a grudge against Philip since then. Philip kept silent. He knew that his mother-in-law's bias against him was not a matter of a few days. Even if he told her now that he was rich and powerful, Martha would not believe him but would make fun of him instead. Wynn could not take it anymore and said coldly:</p>  <p id = > \"Mom, can you stop making a fuss? We are all aware of your attitude toward Philip over the years. Has he ever complained about it? Why must you make me divorce him?\" Wynn was not someone who had no temper. She had to keep her mouth shut considering that Martha was her mom. However, this was the last straw. \"Yes! You two must sign the divorce papers today. I have already arranged for you to go on blind dates in the next few days. I think that Juan Parker and Aiden Grant are worth considering,\" Martha said angrily. It was even on the news. Wynn could not be bothered to quarrel with her mother anymore. She turned to Philip and said, \"Philip, do you really have a way to treat Mila’s illness?\" Philip turned his head and said with a smile on his face, \"Don't worry, I have already got in touch with the hospital. Mila will be admitted this afternoon.\" Wynn nodded and felt really relieved. \"Hospital?\" Martha saw that things were not going her way, so she quickly said to Wynn, \"Wynn, don’t believe this useless bum! Between the</p>  <p id = > two of you, how much money do you have to treat Mila’s illness? \"Wynn, I am not forcing you, it's all for your own good. What future is there for you if you stay with him?\" Martha changed her strategy and said earnestly.</p>  <p id = > However, Wynn saw through her and said, \"Are you doing it for me or yourself?\" Wynn was very clear about her mother's character and temperament. Martha did it just because she wanted Wynn to marry someone rich so that she could hold her head high in front of her family.</p>  <p id = > She did not care about her daughter’s happiness. As soon as Martha heard that, she immediately acted like a cat whose tail was stepped on. She was furious and scolded, \"Wynn, what do you mean by that? Do you think that I would put you in harm’s way?\" Martha was mad. ‘How is my daughter so stupid? She is favoring an outsider over me.’ Wynn could not be bothered with her anymore. She turned around and intended to walk away with Philip.</p>  <p id = > Martha did not want to let them leave. She immediately sat on the ground and slapped her thighs. She cryingly said, \"God, you don't want me to live.</p>  <p id = > My son-in-law is a piece of trash, and my daughter is favoring an outsider over me. What do you want me to do? I should just be dead.\" Wynn felt a headache coming when Martha started throwing a tantrum, so she hurriedly ran to hold her mother. Martha refused to get up. She pushed away Wynn's hand and continued to hit her chest and legs. \"If you don't get divorced today, I will eat rat poison and drink herbicide.\" Wynn had a terrible headache now. She said, \"Mom, please stop messing around.\" \"Messing around?\" Martha immediately got up and said in an agitated tone, \"Can you really trust this useless bum? He has been with us for three years and how has he contributed to our family? What has he given you? When both of you got married, his parents didn’t even show up. Are they dead or do they despise us?\" Martha crossed a line with what she said. She said that her in-laws were dead. How would Martha react if she knew that her in-laws were the richest family in the world? Philip's expression turned gloomy in an instant. Wynn was also very angry and said, \"Mom, how can you say such horrible things? For once, can you take other people's feelings into</p>  <p id = > account?! Regardless, Philip is your son-in-law. Aren’t you ashamed of yourself? \"I’m telling you today in your face that I will not divorce Philip.</p>  <p id = > If you want to sever our relationship, please feel free to do so!\" Whenever Wynn got pissed, she could be quite relentless. Right now, Martha was exasperated. She raised her hand angrily and slapped Wynn!</p>  <h2 id =chapter-123 > Chapter 123</h2>  <p id = > Smack! It was a crisp-sounding slap! Martha cursed at her, \"Get out of this house! Don’t ever come back! You are no longer a child of mine!\" It was heart-rending for Philip when he saw Wynn get slapped. He stared at Martha with an angry gaze, champing to tear her apart! Even if she was his mother-in-law, she had bullied Wynn, so Philip needed to step in to teach her a lesson! Philip put down Mila and walked over angrily with a daunting expression. Martha was also frightened and cried out, \"You… What do you want to do?\" \"You shouldn't hit Wynn,\" Philip said coldly. He had his fists squeezed tightly and he was trembling slightly. Wynn, with dazzling red imprints on her face, immediately stopped Philip. \"Philip, calm down. Let's head home.\" She was really afraid that Philip would do something impulsive. If that happened, there would be no way out of it. \"Okay.\"</p>  <p id = > Philip's expression gradually softened. Martha was very nervous at first.</p>  <p id = > When she saw Wynn stepping in to stop Philip, however, she immediately shouted angrily, \"What did you want to do just now? You wanted to lay your hands on me?\" Philip looked at Martha coldly and refused to give up.</p>  <p id = > This was the first time he had been so aggressive in the Johnston family.</p>  <p id = > When she saw how Philip looked at her, Martha instinctively felt guilty. She stepped back a few steps as if she was before a tiger instead of a spineless coward. He terrified her! How can this good-for-nothing exert such an imposing manner? Seeing that things were going wrong, Charles immediately got up and said coldly to Philip, \"Philip, what do you think you’re doing? She is your mother-in-law! Do you really want to lay a hand on her?\" Philip sighed, then glanced at Martha and Charles before saying</p>  <p id = > coldly, \"Think of this as a warning. Don't force Wynn to do anything she doesn't want to do.\" After he was done speaking, Philip left the Johnston house with Wynn and Mila. After they left, Martha was soaked in sweat and sat limply on the sofa. After a while, she gritted her teeth with hatred and shouted madly, \"Charles, look at that! That piece of garbage is fighting back.</p>  <p id = > He even dared to threaten us! Who does he think he is?!\" Martha was also putting up a front. She knew that she was in the wrong. Charles shook his head helplessly. \"Martha, can't you stop for a few days? Do you have to break up your daughter's marriage?\" \"What do you mean? Why are you pretending to be the good guy now? Can our daughter really have a good life if she stays with that useless bum?\" Martha took her anger toward Philip out on Charles. \"Don't forget, it will be Dad's 70th birthday in a few days.</p>  <p id = > Are you really planning to bring this piece of trash and b*stard child to Dad’s birthday?\" Charles was very aware of the virtues of his wife. Sooner or later, this family would be turned upside down by her. He shook his head and said, \"I'm going for a walk.\" He walked off after he said that. Martha gritted her teeth angrily and muttered, \"Sooner or later, I will find a way to split up Wynn and that wimp!\" On the other end, after Philip and Wynn left the Johnston house, they headed straight to the hospital. Philip said that Mila could be admitted this afternoon. Wynn had been curious about the doctor that Philip contacted. Last time, he said that it was Professor Henry Turner, but Wynn did not believe it. After all, Professor Turner was a legend in the medical world. ‘Does Philip really have what it takes to get him on board?’</p>  <p id = > Unfortunately, Wynn and Philip ran into Juan Parker as soon as they arrived at the hospital. \"Wynn, why didn’t you tell me that you’ve been discharged from the hospital?\" Juan walked over. Wynn smiled and said, \"Hey Juan.</p>  <p id = > Sorry, I left the hospital last night and didn't have the time to tell you.\" Wynn was grateful for Juan’s help over the years. However, the more that he helped her with, the more uncomfortable she felt. \"By the way, what are you doing here?\" Juan was puzzled when he saw Mila who was in Philip's arms.</p>  <p id = > \"We are arranging for Mila to be hospitalized. Philip said that he has</p>  <p id = > contacted the doctor. Mila will be soon nursed back to health,\" Wynn said truthfully. Juan was taken aback. He sneered. \"Wynn, why would you listen to Philip? What is the capability of the doctor that he contacted? What if that doctor delays Mila’s treatment? I have already contacted Professor Turner. He is here today to see a special patient. I begged him for a long time before he agreed to take a look at Mila.\" As he was talking, he glanced at Philip triumphantly. However, Philip completely ignored him and was preoccupied with playing with Mila. “No… There’s no need for that. Philip has sorted it out.\" Wynn found it hard to refuse Juan. To be honest, she really wanted Professor Turner to take a look at Mila, but Philip had already got in touch with a doctor. If she went with Juan at this time, it would seem like she did not trust Philip. Juan's expression changed. He turned his head to look at Philip and asked with a false smile, \"Philip, what doctor did you contact? Is he any good?\" Philip said calmly, \"You don't know anything about the special patient that Professor Turner came to visit today?\"</p>  <h2 id =chapter-124 > Chapter 124</h2>  <p id = > Juan was startled. With a suspicious look, he said, \"What do you mean?\"</p>  <p id = > Suddenly, he felt that the Philip in front of him today was a little different.</p>  <p id = > However, he could not really put a finger on what was different about Philip.</p>  <p id = > Philip said indifferently, \"Don’t worry about it. I just want to tell you that I can do what you can't do.\" Philip had endured Juan's provocation for a long time. Today, he did not mind letting Juan know about his actual capabilities.</p>  <p id = > \"Philip, have you gone mad? Are you trying to tell me that the patient that Professor Turner is meeting today is Mila?\" Juan said in a mocking tone with a cold expression in his eyes. ‘Who does this piece of trash think he is?</p>  <p id = > Professor Turner is a legend. Even for someone with my background, I had to beg him for a long time. So how can someone like Philip get in contact with him?’ Philip did not deny it but instead smiled faintly. \"You'll find out in a while.\" \"Okay, Philip, you have become a better liar now. Do you know how much work it takes to get Professor Turner to see a patient? There are</p>  <p id = > hundreds of rich and powerful people asking for him every day… But do you think that just because one is rich and powerful, they can get Professor Turner to take them on as a patient? Do you know how many entrepreneurs and rich people have been rejected by Professor Turner?\" Juan looked at Philip sarcastically, his expression cold. \"Professor Turner's medical fees alone cost several million. Can you afford that?\" Juan was not to blame for despising Philip. The main issue here was that it was really almost impossible to get Professor Turner to take on a patient. If it were not for his father, perhaps Professor Turner would not even look at Juan. Philip sent Mila to Wynn's arms and said calmly, \"Nothing is absolute. How can you be so sure that I can't get Professor Turner?\" Juan laughed presumptuously.</p>  <p id = > He turned his head to look at Wynn and pointed at Philip accusingly,</p>  <p id = > \"Wynn, are you seeing this? Philip is not even blushing when he is lying.</p>  <p id = > He thinks that he can get Professor Turner!\" Wynn kept silent. She looked at Mila who was in her arms, then looked at Philip with some embarrassment. \"Philip, if you are not in contact with Professor Turner, don’t worry about it. There is no need to talk about this in front of Juan. It’s not an issue if it’s another doctor.\" Wynn did not want to embarrass Philip.</p>  <p id = > She turned to Juan with a smile, \"Juan, sorry, don't blame Philip. I really appreciate you helping me, but you also know how it is with Mila’s condition. We’ll bring Mila to the doctor that Philip has contacted today. If it doesn’t work out, I’ll wait another half a month.\" Wynn said that because she also did not want to embarrass Juan. Juan looked indifferent and said,</p>  <p id = > \"Wynn, you understand what I mean. I will continue to keep in touch with Professor Turner, but I hope you will consider whether Philip can give you and Mila a good life. Even if you don't think about it for yourself, do take Mila's future into consideration.\" Juan did not even blush after such an obvious provocation. Philip frowned and said coldly, \"Juan, you don’t need to worry about Wynn and Mila's future. Got it?\" He was very upset. Juan was also very upset. He argued, \"Philip, show me what you can bring to the table for Wynn and Mila. Don’t talk when you have nothing to show for.’</p>  <p id = > Who was the one that had nothing to show for? At this moment, Philip's phone rang. The tension between him and Juan suddenly dissipated. He walked aside and noticed that it was Professor Turner who was calling. \"Mr.</p>  <p id = > Clarke, I have arrived. Where are you?\" Professor Turner was being very respectful on the phone. He had been preparing for today for a long time and brought along his best apprentices. It was to ensure that things were bulletproof. The plan was to conduct a targeted check-up with Mr. Clarke's daughter and optimize a treatment plan. \"I'm in the emergency room building,\" Philip replied. \"Okay, I'll be there right away. Please wait for me.\"</p>  <p id = > Professor Turner sounded very excited. After he hung up the phone, Philip walked over and smiled at Wynn. \"Wynn, the doctor that I contacted will be here soon. You will know who it is in a while.\" Wynn nodded. Juan sneered sarcastically. \"That's great timing. I do want to see the doctor that you’ve contacted.\" When he said this, Juan looked at Wynn and said in an ingratiating manner, \"Wynn, don't worry. I will contact Professor Turner now and ask him to come too.\" After he said that, he took out his phone and deliberately dialed a number as if to show off in front of Philip. He respectfully said, \"Hello Professor Turner, where are you? Do you need me to pick you up?\" Professor Turner was rushing to the emergency room building and casually replied, \"I'm almost at the emergency room building.</p>  <p id = > You can wait for me over there.\" He hung up the phone after that. Juan nodded and thanked Professor Turner, then proudly said to Philip,</p>  <p id = > \"Professor Turner is coming to the emergency room building, and he will be here in a short while.\" Juan sneered in his heart. He did not expect such a coincidence in the world. This was a slap in Philip’s face arranged by God.</p>  <p id = > The timing was perfect!</p>  <h2 id =chapter-125 > Chapter 125</h2>  <p id = > Juan was not to blame. After all, he did not have the capacity to think about why Professor Turner was coming to the emergency room. In Juan’s mind, the probability that the doctor that Philip had been in contact with was</p>  <p id = > Professor Turner was impossibly low. Wynn was a little embarrassed. She did not want Philip to be looked down on again. Philip mentioned previously that he had been in contact with Professor Turner. However, no one believed him, not even Wynn. That was the case even after Philip opened up to her last night and told her that his family was fairly comfortable and that he had around two million dollars in savings. However, she was partial to Juan when it came to the matter of Professor Turner. After all, even if one had the money, one may not necessarily have the connection. Furthermore, Wynn still doubted whether Philip really had two million dollars. \"Philip, forget about it. Just apologize to Juan, there is no need to go on like this.\"</p>  <p id = > Wynn looked at Philip earnestly. No one had to be embarrassed if they could arrive at a concession. However, Philip patted Wynn on the shoulder and said, \"Trust me, Wynn. I will do what I say.\" After he said that, he teased Mila and asked her, \"Mila, do you trust Dad?\" \"I trust you.\" Mila laughed innocently. It was also at this time that Professor Turner arrived with four of his most capable apprentices. They were running all the way to the entrance of the emergency room building. Juan immediately greeted him with a smile on his face and said flatteringly, \"Professor Turner, you are here! Look at you, you’re sweating. There is no need to rush about for me.\"</p>  <p id = > This was him low-key boasting and showing off. Professor Turner frowned and glanced at Juan. He had no feelings toward this arrogant young man. If it were not for the beautiful jade that Juan’s dad gave him, he really did not want to entertain Juan. Therefore, Professor Turner only nodded slightly toward him. At the same time, he was looking around while trying to locate Mr. Philip. When he saw Mr. Philip, Professor Turner smiled and was about to trot over. However, Juan stopped Professor Turner and said, \"Professor Turner, please stay put. I want to talk to you about something.\" Professor Turner raised his gray eyebrows and looked a little impatient. He asked,</p>  <p id = > \"What can't you wait to talk about?\" ‘What’s up with Juan? What’s so important that he has to say it right now?’ Juan immediately moved close to his ears and said, \"Professor Turner, I have a friend with me today. He’s the</p>  <p id = > father of the child that I’m asking you to treat. He found an unknown doctor and said that you are nothing but someone with undeserved fame. He wants to put you against that unknown doctor. Show him how it’s supposed to be done.\" Juan was trying to stir sh*t. Professor Turner's expression changed immediately. He said coldly, \"Where is he? I want to meet him.\" Professor Turner did not take the insult saying that he was someone with undeserved fame kindly. Every doctor had to defend their honor. Juan immediately turned his head, sneered smugly, and shouted at Philip, \"Philip, when is the doctor that you’ve been in contact with arriving? Professor Turner also wants to see if your doctor has what it takes. \" Philip raised his eyebrows and glanced at Juan who had a scornful expression. He said, \"He's already here.\" He was already here? Juan turned his head and looked around. Apart from the few people with Professor Turner, there were no other doctors there. ‘Is he trying to say that the doctor that he’s in contact with is Professor Turner? ‘What a joke.’ Juan immediately sneered and said, \"Philip, where is he? Could it be that you didn’t actually contact any doctor and are lying your way out of it? \"Wynn, I told you so, Philip is a useless piece of trash.</p>  <p id = > He will never amount to anything. Look around. Where is the doctor that he mentioned?\" Juan's face was full of irony, and his eyebrows were raised.</p>  <p id = > His smile was very contemptuous. \"Shut up! Who do you think you are?</p>  <p id = > How dare you talk to Mr. Philip like this?\" Suddenly! Professor Turner’s beratement made Juan tremble with fright. He immediately asked,</p>  <p id = > \"Professor Turner, what are you doing?\" Professor Turner glared at him, then walked up to Philip respectfully with a smile. He said, \"Mr. Philip, I have brought four of my best apprentices. If you are ready, we can start the examination on your daughter.\" Juan looked at Philip with a stunned expression, feeling incredibly dumbfounded. He was in shock. ‘What’s going on?’ Wynn's eyes were wide open as she could not believe what had just happened.</p>  <h2 id =chapter-126 > Chapter 126</h2>  <p id = > Professor Turner had really come for Philip! This was astonishing. In the eyes of Juan, Philip was a complete loser! What was it about him that made Professor Turner treat him so respectfully? Wait! Juan recalled the time he saw Philip and Professor Turner in the rest area of the hospital. ‘Did Professor Turner also come specifically for him at that time?” All of a sudden, Juan panicked. At the same time, he was very angry. ‘This is impossible! It must be a mistake!’ Wynn still had her eyes opened wide. She looked at Philip in disbelief, her tiny mouth opening slightly. With her lips trembling, she asked, \"Philip… Philip, did you really get Professor Turner?\"</p>  <p id = > ‘How is this happening?’ If this happened in the past, Wynn would think that this Professor Turner was an impostor. However, after what happened last night, Wynn got to know the other side of Philip. Although, even if Philip's family was well to do, it still would not have led to Professor Turner treating him so respectfully. He was a leading authority of medicine, a big shot who was sought after by countless people. At this moment though, he was bending over backward for her husband. A highly respected medical saint in his 60s or 70s was acting so humbly to a young man in his 20s. If the magnates and entrepreneurs who had begged Professor Turner to treat them found out about this, they would probably be shocked too. ‘Is Philip still hiding something from me? What exactly does his family do?’ Philip saw through Wynn’s doubts and said with a smile, \"Professor Turner is an old friend of my dad’s. My dad also sponsored his research. Isn’t that right, Professor Turner?\" As he talked, Philip looked at Professor Turner who immediately understood him. Professor Turner nodded and smiled, \"Yes, Miss Wynn. Mr. Philip's father sponsored our research project previously. I wanted to return the favor.\" \"That is impossible! How can this be? Philip is a good-for-nothing! His father… Sponsorship? Professor Turner, do you know what you are talking about?\" Juan was consumed by his anger and dared to question Professor Turner. ‘Where is Philip's father? Isn't he an orphan?’ This was what Philip had told him when they were in college.</p>  <p id = > Sponsorship? What a joke! Professor Turner was talking as if Philip's family</p>  <p id = > was rich. If he had the money, why would he have gone through such a hard time with Wynn? Why would he ignore Mila’s illness? Professor Turner's facial expression turned gloomy. He turned around and said coldly, \"Don't you dare be rude! Mr. Philip's father is not someone you can afford to slander! If you dare be rude to Mr. Philip, don't blame me for turning my back against you.\" Juan had made a very bad move. He must not want to live if he dared to be rude to Mr. Philip's father. Did he not know that Mr.</p>  <p id = > Philip's father can affect a country's GDP with a snap of his fingers?! Juan trembled and panicked. He apologized in a hurry, \"I'm sorry, Professor Turner, I was consumed by my emotions.\" \"Hmph!\" Professor Turner snorted coldly and then said, \"Tomorrow I will have someone send back the jade that your dad gave me. From now on, the Parker family has nothing to do with me!\" Smack! This was undoubtedly a loud slap that hit Juan's face hard. Juan immediately freaked out and apologized over and over.</p>  <p id = > \"Professor Turner, I’m sorry. Please don’t do that. Otherwise, my dad will kill me.\" Professor Turner said to him directly, \"Don't apologize to me, you have to apologize to Mr. Philip.\" Philip Clarke? Juan turned his face to look at Philip. He had a complex expression. ‘Why is this happening? Why is Professor Turner so respectful toward a piece of trash? Who the hell is he?!’</p>  <p id = > Juan gritted his teeth bitterly, squeezed out a bleak smile, and said, \"Philip, considering that I have always been kind to Mila, can you please put in a good word for me with Professor Turner?\" ‘I refuse to comply! I, Juan, had to actually apologize to Philip Clarke!’ Wynn, who was on the side, said,</p>  <p id = > \"Philip, can you let it go out of respect for me?\" Since his wife had spoken up, Philip would not be bothered with it anymore. He calmly said, \"There should be no such example next time.\" After that, he carried Mila and entered the hospital with Professor Turner. Juan stood alone at the entrance.</p>  <p id = > His body was soaked in a cold sweat. He had an angry expression on his face, and his fists were held tight. He turned and left! After he got in the car, he slammed the door shut and slapped the steering wheel brutally. Juan was extremely upset, and this upset feeling quickly turned into hatred! \"Why!\"</p>  <p id = > Juan roared in the car before taking out his phone. He was panting heavily, trembling with anger all over. With a grim coldness in the corner of his eyes, he said, \"Let’s bring it forward, the day after tomorrow!\" Smack! After he hung up the call, Juan looked angrily in the direction of the hospital entrance. At that moment, he was full of hatred. ‘Wynn, I must have you!</p>  <p id = > Must!’</p>  <h2 id =chapter-127 > Chapter 127</h2>  <p id = > While Professor Turner was doing a comprehensive check-up on Mila, Wynn took Philip to the rest area and stared at him. Philip shrugged helplessly and decided to be honest. \"Well, let me be honest, Professor Turner used to be my father's private doctor. \"Private doctor?\" Wynn was surprised, her eyes were sparkling. ‘Who was Philip's father? He had the means to hire Professor Turner as his private doctor?’ \"Philip, is there nothing else that you want to tell me?\" Wynn asked again, her face showing slight anger. ‘Philip must still be hiding something from me.’ Philip immediately hugged Wynn’s waist. He smiled and said, “There’s really nothing else. Professor Turner was not so famous at that time. My dad had an issue with his health, so he asked Professor Turner to be his private doctor. I don't have a reason to lie to you. If I am lying, I will be struck by lightning...\" Just as Philip wanted to make an oath, Wynn immediately covered his mouth, glared at him with a coquettish look, and said, \"Okay, I believe you.\" Philip grinned and scratched Wynn's nose. Wynn shyly turned away, then rolled her eyes at him and said, \"What are you doing? There are so many people here.\" Professor Turner took over the remaining matters regarding Mila, so Wynn returned to the company. Not only was the issue with Mila’s operation solved, but Professor Turner was also now the main physician. Wynn was in a happy mood the entire day. At the same time, her view of Philip had also changed a lot. She was thinking about where she should inform her parents about this matter. ‘Forget about it. I’ll do it after some time, mom is probably still angry.’ Back at the company, Wynn felt</p>  <p id = > that her colleagues seemed to be avoiding her. “Hey, Mindy, what's happening?\" Wynn asked her assistant. The assistant looked around before saying, \"Wynn, a new Vice President joined the company in the past few days that you have not been around. The VP is a woman. I heard that she is Mr. Hall’s lover. She has a bad temper. She namedropped you this morning and said that she would target you.\" Wynn smiled and said, \"I don't know the new VP, why does she want to target me?\" The assistant sighed helplessly, and said, \"Because someone told on you, saying that you are romantically involved with Mr. Hall.\" Wynn was startled. There was really nowhere to hide from the malicious competition in the workplace. However, she was not bothered by it. She said with a smile, \"It's OK, let's not speak or act on hearsay. Mr. Hall and I are innocent, I’m not worried about it.\" Her assistant nodded, but still dropped her a gentle reminder. \"Wynn, I would advise you to keep watch, the new VP is not someone to be trifled with, Mr.</p>  <p id = > Hall puts a lot of weight on her words.\" Wynn nodded to indicate that she was listening, and then she brought along the proposal for Turner’s Second Hospital to the chairman's office. After half an hour, Wynn came out of the chairman's office. A woman that looked stand-offish walked towards her; she had big wavy hair and wore big crystal earrings. She carried an aura that declared that ‘I am a queen’. At first glance, one would know that she was not someone to be trifled with. Wynn smiled, nodded, and said hello to her.</p>  <p id = > However, the woman walked straight to Wynn, raised her hand, and slapped Wynn's face hard! Smack! This slap was done in front of everyone in the company. Everyone took a deep breath. No one dared to step in; everyone chose to keep their head down and watched silently. Wynn was dumbfounded, and her cheeks were burning hot from the slap. \"You are Wynn?\" The woman asked coldly. Wynn stared at her angrily and asked,</p>  <p id = > \"Who are you and why did you hit me?\" The woman sneered and slapped her again. She pointed at Wynn’s nose and said, \"My name is Yasmin, the new VP and Mr. Hall’s girlfriend. Consider this a warning, stop harassing Mr. Hall. Otherwise, I will slap you every time I see you!\" She was</p>  <p id = > domineering and arrogant! This was Yasmin Lewis, the newly appointed Vice President of Beacon Pharmaceutical. Wynn was mad, she had not expected Yasmin to be so domineering and unreasonable. It seemed that she was only in her early twenties. At that exact time, Derrick Hall came out of his office. When he saw what was going on, he shouted, \"VP Yasmin, what are you doing?\" Yasmin had a brazen look on her face. With her hands across her chest, she walked off, but not before she gave Wynn a cold stare.</p>  <p id = > In the office, no one dared to speak. Derrick looked at Wynn. He felt very guilty and motioned Wynn to come into his office. He apologized. \"VP</p>  <p id = > Johnston, I'm so sorry, I apologize on behalf of Yasmin, please forgive her.\"</p>  <p id = > As he spoke, Derrick took out a card, handed it to Wynn, and said, \"Here are one hundred thousand dollars. I heard that your daughter has some medical expenses, just think of it as my contribution towards it.\" Wynn did not take the card, but said coldly, \"There is no need for that, Mr. Hall, if there’s nothing else, I'll be leaving now.\" After that, Wynn turned around and left Derrick Hall's office, then returned to her office. Her assistant ran over and asked in distress, \"Wynn, are you okay? I didn't expect that Yasmin could be so arrogant and Mr. Hall wouldn’t take action.\" Wynn was very upset; she looked in the mirror and saw the red palm prints on her face along with the two bloodstained cuts on her right cheek from Yasmin’s nails. Was Wynn not pissed off? She was pissed off. However, she was just a manager of the marketing department; Yasmin was the new VP and Mr. Hall's lover.</p>  <p id = > Her only option was to deal with it. This was the ruthlessness of the workplace. After she got off work, Wynn returned to the hospital in a bad mood and accompanied Mila in the VIP Inpatient Suite. When Philip came over, Wynn found an excuse to leave. Mila was wearing a pink medical gown. She tugged on Philip sleeve and said innocently, \"Dad, mom was crying, I think mom even hurt her face.\" ‘Wynn cried and had hurt her face?’</p>  <p id = > Philip wrinkled his brows, ran out, and found Wynn. Wynn tried to turn away, but Philip still saw the injury. There were red marks on her face. The two scratches were clearly caused by someone’s nails! \"Who did this to</p>  <p id = > you?!\" Philip was angry; there was a furious chill in his eyes that had a murderous intent! ‘Someone dared to hit Wynn! That is unforgivable!’</p>  <p id = > Damn!!!</p>  <h2 id =chapter-128 > Chapter 128</h2>  <p id = > Philip was beyond furious! Someone had hit Wynn, that was unforgivable!</p>  <p id = > When she saw how angry Philip was, Wynn hurriedly grabbed his arms and explained, \"It’s a misunderstanding, no one laid their hands on me, it’s just...it’s just me being clumsy.\" Wynn was diffident, she did not want to see Philip causing trouble because of her. After all, not only was it the company where she worked, but it was also the new vice president, the lover of the chairman, who hit her. It was not worth it. \"This is an accident?\"</p>  <p id = > Philip's eyes were sharp, he would not believe what Wynn had said. \"It’s really just me being clumsy, it has nothing to do with anyone.\" Wynn held onto Philip and kept trying to calm him down. \"Philip, don't you believe me?\" Philip became quiet when he heard that. He could see that Wynn did not want to cause trouble, but he felt very uncomfortable if he did nothing about it. Philip felt helpless. He reached his hand out and touched her delicate cheek, and asked in a gentle and concerned tone, \"Does it hurt?\"</p>  <p id = > Wynn's eyes were red, she shook her head and said, \"Don’t worry about it, it’s just a small cut, it's nothing. Can you not get so upset next time? It scares me.\" Yes. As anger flooded Philip’s veins, Wynn felt as though he was like a tiger that should never be provoked. The rage that flowed through his body made it feel like he was going to tear the whole world apart. Philip nodded, but still could not let it go. Since Wynn refused to talk about the matter, he would conduct his own investigation. So, the next day, Philip drove Wynn to work. After she entered the company building, Philip made a call. After a while, a woman walked out of the building entrance. It was Wynn’s assistant, Mindy Scott. Mindy was in a bad mood today. When she saw Philip grinning and waving at her from a distance, she wanted to turn around and leave. She knew Philip. Wynn brought Philip along for a company</p>  <p id = > dinner previously. It was also during that dinner where Mindy noted that Philip was a good-for-nothing. Therefore, she lost all interest in Philip.</p>  <p id = > However, Philip called her out of the blue, saying that he had something to ask her. \"Hey, what do you need from me?\" Mindy walked up to Philip with a chilly attitude. She had her hands across her chest, her eyelids narrowed, and it was obvious that she looked down on him. Philip did not put any thoughts into her attitude toward him. He smiled and said, \"Let’s grab coffee.\" Coffee? Mindy was taken aback and immediately said angrily,</p>  <p id = > \"Philip, I didn't expect you to be this kind of person! I won’t turn my back on Wynn, can you drop it!\" She had not expected that Philip would come on to her. What a disgusting piece of trash! Philip was also taken aback. He immediately understood what Mindy thought, and did not know whether to laugh or cry. He said, \"It’s all in your head. I’ve contacted you because I have something to ask you, nothing more.\" \"Really?\" Mindy was suspicious.</p>  <p id = > In the coffee shop, Philip ordered a cappuccino and some desserts for Mindy. He knew that Mindy was a glutton, especially towards desserts.</p>  <p id = > When Phillip saw Mindy staring straight at the desserts on the table and could not look away, he knew that he had made the right call. Mindy felt herself struggle in her heart; she wrenched her eyes away from the desserts, suppressed her urges, and asked, \"What can I do for you? Aren’t you worried that Wynn would find out about this and give you a hard time?\"</p>  <p id = > Philip did not reply, but said with a grin, \"Don’t worry about it. These are all for you. Don’t be shy, feel free to help yourself.\" Mindy swallowed her saliva, pointed at the desserts, and asked, \"It’s really all for me?\" Philip nodded. Mindy hesitated for a moment, picked up the spoon, and dug in.</p>  <p id = > She stomped her feet happily, her eyes narrowed in bliss, and had a lovely smile on her face. Philip did not expect to win her over so easily.</p>  <h2 id =chapter-129 > Chapter 129</h2>  <p id = > \"Philip, get straight to the point. As long as it's something to do with the company, I will definitely know something about it,\" Mindy said. Gifts do</p>  <p id = > blinds the eye. Philip pondered for a moment and asked, \"Yesterday, did someone hurt Wynn?\" “....” Mindy was taken aback. She wiped her mouth and looked like she was struggling internally. Finally, she nodded and said,</p>  <p id = > \"Well, there’s a new Vice President that joined our company. Her name is Yasmin, she is our chairman's lover.\" \"Why did she hit Wynn?\" \"Yasmin thought that Wynn had hooked up with Mr. Hall, so she did it as a warning to Wynn.\" \"Where did this take place?\" \"In the office...She slapped Wynn twice in front of all the colleagues. I really felt that Wynn was wronged.</p>  <p id = > Yasmin is really overbearing. With the chairman at her beck and call, she has already slapped several people in the company,\" Mindy said bitterly.</p>  <p id = > Suddenly, Mindy seemed to have thought of something; her eyes opened wide and she asked, \"Philip, don’t tell me that you’re thinking of teaching Yasmin a lesson on behalf of Wynn?\" ‘Does Philip really dare to do that?’</p>  <p id = > He was a good-for-nothing. If he dared to do something to Yasmin, Wynn would not be able to remain in the company anymore. Mindy immediately advised him. \"Philip, I know you care a lot about Wynn, but my advice to you is to not interfere in this matter, otherwise it would harm Wynn.\" Philip smiled calmly. He took out his phone and said, \"Okay, I know what I can and can’t do. I’ll get the bill and head off first.” After that, Philip got up and left. Mindy looked at Philip, who was leaving, and suddenly felt that Philip was more than meets the eye. Moreover, she felt that this matter would not just go away. At the same time, Wynn was in her office having a headache dealing with the matter of Turner’s Second Hospital. This matter was delayed because of Gavin Zach. Mr. Hall had made it clear to her that this partnership had to go through. Boom! Her office door violently burst open from the outside. Yasmin stomped in with a murderous look on her face and threw the documents in her hand on Wynn’s desk. She severely reprimanded Wynn. “Wynn, why haven’t you sorted out the partnership with Turner’s second Hospital? Do you still want your job? If you can’t get it done, it’s best you start packing now. I don’t want to waste the company’s resources to support someone as useless as you.\" Wynn immediately got up, smiled,</p>  <p id = > and said to Yasmin, \"VP Lewis, I am managing the partnership with Turner's Second Hospital. I will be having a meeting with the correspondent this afternoon.\" Yasmin immediately turned around. With a chilly look on her face, she pointed her finger at Wynn’s nose and started screaming, \"This afternoon? Why didn’t you go this morning? Is this really the level of efficiency that the marketing department operates in? Manager Wynn, as the Vice President of the company, I have to think about the company. I will give you three days. If you can't secure the Turner's Second Hospital partnership in three days, you can tend in your resignation!\" Yasmin was there to pick a fight. Three days?! Even if she had seven days, she would not be able to secure the Turner's Second Hospital partnership. She did some research. Turner's Second Hospital had recently shut their doors and declined seeing visitors, they were not open to any partnerships. Even if Wynn had gone over, she would still be turned away. ‘B*tch, you’ll be gone soon enough.’ Wynn immediately explained, \"VP Lewis, Turner's Second Hospital’s partnership will definitely not be sorted out in three days. You should also know that Turner's Second Hospital partnership is not something that can be secured in three days. I...\" Smack! Before Wynn finished speaking, Yasmin slapped her and said coldly, \"Manager Jiang, this slap is to wake you up. Remember, you will always be an employee of the company, you are just a manager of the Marketing department; I am the Vice President, my words are gold, you can't go against me, do you understand me?!\" Wynn clenched her fists tightly; her eyes were red, and her eyes were fixed on Yasmin. Her colleagues were looking from outside the door, they all felt uneasy for Wynn. The newly appointed Vice President was obviously picking a fight. Wynn would not have an easy time at the company. Mindy had already returned by then. When she saw it, she immediately sent a message to Philip, ‘Philip, Yasmin is picking a fight with Wynn again, she slapped Wynn again!’ Philip had been waiting downstairs.</p>  <p id = > He had nothing to do today, so he was waiting for Wynn to leave work and then invite her to dinner. When he saw the message, Philip’s temper</p>  <p id = > immediately flared up! ‘That d*mn Yasmin! She’s digging her own grave!’</p>  <p id = > Philip went straight into the building and went to the floor Beacon Pharmaceutical was on! In the office... Yasmin saw that Wynn was staring at her and sneered. Her hands wrapped around her chest and she said angrily,</p>  <p id = > \"Are you still not convinced?\" Wynn held her tears. She swallowed her grievances and said, \"VP Lewis, you’re right, I will go get it sorted now.\"</p>  <p id = > After she said that, Wynn turned around, picked up her bag, and left. Yasmin had not intended to let Wynn off the hook that easily. She grabbed the bag in Wynn's hand and threw it to the ground, then started screaming at her,</p>  <p id = > \"Wynn, consider this a warning, don't pretend to be innocent in front of me.</p>  <p id = > I can squish you like you are an ant! If you are smarter than you look, you would leave the company as soon as possible. Otherwise, I’ll have my fun with you!\" Wynn looked at the items from her bag that was now all scattered on the floor. With tears in her eyes, she said, \"VP Lewis, I didn't do anything to offend you, why are you picking on me?\" Yasmin said with a frosty expression, \"Picking on you? Wynn, you think too highly of yourself.</p>  <p id = > Wh*res like you are all too common to me. You pretend to be a lady during day time and reveal your true sl*tty self at night. Take a look in the mirror before you seduce my boyfriend.\" Swear words started pouring out like a waterfall out of Yasmin’s mouth. She had intended to put Wynn to shame.</p>  <p id = > ‘I can see through you, you b*tch. I will f*ck you up.’ \"I have no such intentions! It’s nonsense!\" Wynn said in an agitated tone. Smack! Yasmin slapped Wynn again, and then creamed, \"B*tch! Are you done? I will put an end to this now! You wh*re!\"</p>  <h2 id =chapter-130 > Chapter 130</h2>  <p id = > The domineering Yasmin slapped Wynn on the face, coming from left, right, and center. Yasmin posed as someone who was extremely arrogant and aggressive who treated anyone as she pleased. \"Wynn, I can squish you like a bug! Let me tell you this, right here right now, if you dare to show up to the company tomorrow, I will send a dozen beggars to r*pe you. Do you</p>  <p id = > take my word for it?!\" Yasmin was wildly audacious. She pointed at Wynn's nose and warned her severely. At that moment, Wynn's hair was unruly, her face was red and full of slap marks. No one who was watching outside the door stepped in and put a stop to Yasmin’s behavior. Who dared to do so?</p>  <p id = > That was the lover of the chairman and also the new Vice President. One word from her would lead to them losing their jobs! Mindy was anxious,</p>  <p id = > ‘Why hasn’t that good-for-nothing Philip here yet? If he doesn't come now, Wynn will be beaten to death!’ Mindy knew she could not wait any longer, she rushed in and shouted, \"Wynn, are you okay? \"VP Lewis, you are abusing her! You laid your hands on her for no reason, I’m going to call the cops!\" Mindy said agitatedly. Yasmin glared at Mindy. She then smirked, raised her hand, and slapped Mindy. \"Little b*tch, know your place! I don't care what your name is, you are fired. F*ck off!\" After cursing at Mindy, Yasmin turned her head, looked at Wynn coldly, and said, \"Wynn, if you kneel down to apologize to me and admit that you’ve tried to seduce Mr.</p>  <p id = > Hall, I will let you off. After all, I am a generous person.\" Wynn held her head high, her eyes glared at Yasmin, and she said, \"Don't even think about it! Mr. Hall and I are innocent, don’t you dare try to frame me for something I didn’t do!\" Yasmin was not the least bit worried about the consequences of humiliating Wynn. To Yasmin, Wynn was just a little b*tch with no background and no influence. She had done her investigation, Wynn had a useless husband and a sick daughter. She can crush Wynn easily if she wanted to! Yasmin grabbed Wynn's hair abruptly and pulled on it hard, then shouted coldly, \"B*tch, you are as stubborn as a mule. Do you believe me when I say that I can get rid of you now! You pretend to be innocent. You wh*re, I will strip you and show everyone your dirty body!\" With that, Yasmin began to tear off Wynn's clothes! The shirt and skirt that Wynn wore were easily torn apart! Wow! A large area of her skin was exposed! Wynn protected her body and Mindy also lent her a helping hand. Smack! Yasmin slapped Wynn again and said angrily, \"How dare you cover yourself? I will slap you dead!\" Suddenly! \"Stop it!\" There was a shocking roar in the office</p>  <p id = > area! When Philip arrived, he happened to see Yasmin arrogantly tearing off Wynn’s clothes. He instantly bared his teeth, his eyes were bloodshot, and his monstrous anger overwhelmed the office area with hundreds of people! He rushed to the front! Philip grabbed Yasmin's falling hand and yanked her away! He looked at Wynn who was trembling all over and the blood-red palm prints on her face. His eyes were seeing red, and an unstoppable killing intent materialized out of Philip! \"Wynnie, I'm sorry, I'm late,\" Philip said softly as he put his coat over Wynn. The moment Wynn saw Philip, tears could not stop rushing out of her eyes. He showed up.</p>  <p id = > When she was at her most helpless and most aggrieved, it was Philip who showed up. She broke into violent tears and rushed into Philip’s arms.</p>  <p id = > \"Philip...\" This bitter cry broke Philip's heart. Wynn broke down and Philip wanted to reduce this world into pieces! Anyone who violated Wynn must be killed! No matter who it was! Philip was not going to let anyone get in his way, even if the other party was a Heavenly God! Philip took a deep breath and comforted her. \"It's okay, I'll take care of it.\" After he spoke, he positioned Wynn behind him and guarded her, then turned to look at the arrogant Yasmin coldly. Yasmin was taken aback just now, but now she was not in a panicked mood at all. Her boyfriend was the company's chairman and she also knew many hoodlums. Who dared to make a move on her?</p>  <h2 id =chapter-131 > Chapter 131</h2>  <p id = > \"You're Wynn's useless husband, Philip?\" Yasmin sneered and showed her contempt for Philip. She had asked around previously and found out that Wynn had a good-for-nothing husband that worked as a food delivery man.</p>  <p id = > ‘So, this is him.’ That was why Yasmin showed even more disdain than Wynn for Philip. She could mess with him as much as she liked. Philip's eyes were red. He stared at Yasmin and asked, \"Are you Yasmin Lewis?\"</p>  <p id = > This woman could rot in hell for all that he cared! Yasmin answered very domineeringly, \"Yes, I am Yasmin, the new Vice President of Beacon. Are you thinking of avenging your wife? Take a look at yourself in the mirror.</p>  <p id = > I’m afraid you don’t know that your wife cheated on you and seduced my boyfriend. I’m teaching her a lesson on how to be a decent human being!\"</p>  <p id = > Yasmin felt that any man would be angry when they heard that their wife had an affair. She wanted to put Wynn in a difficult position. Wynn’s eyes were full of tears. She shook her head as she was choking up. \"Philip, I didn't do it, no...\" Philip was calm and clearly did not believe what Yasmin had said. He glanced at Wynn tenderly and gave her a look that conveyed ‘I trust you’. It instantly made her feel safe. Suddenly! Philip grinned indifferently, went up to Yasmin, and kicked her hard in the stomach! At that moment, the whole company went quiet! Everyone was stunned and kept watching in disbelief! Mindy was even more surprised; she covered her mouth, her eyes widened. ‘Had Philip gone mad? He dared to kick Yasmin?! It's over, it's all over! Wynn is as good as gone now!’ However, the next second, Philip grinned and walked slowly toward Yasmin. He then grabbed her wavy hair and pulled her up from the ground. Next... Smack! Philip slapped Yasmin's face! Yasmin's face was slapped so hard that it snapped toward the other direction. There was a fiery pain on her face! Yasmin widened her eyes and stared at the guy in front of her with disbelief all over her face. She roared hysterically, \"You useless piece of sh*t, you dare to f*ck with me?</p>  <p id = > Do you know who I am?\" \"Ha ha.\" Smack! It was another heavy-handed slap on her face! Smack! Smack! Yasmin became more and more dazed with each slap. Following that, Philip kicked her on the belly again and knocked her to the ground! Yasmin's face was swollen until it looked like a pig's head. Her mouth was full of blood, she laid on the ground and clutched onto her stomach. She started shouting hysterically, \"Philip, you are dead!</p>  <p id = > Your wife is dead too! You dared to lay your hands on me and I will make sure you pay for it!\" However, Philip stared at Yasmin who was yelling on the ground indifferently, and said, \"I don't care who you are, and I won’t bother to find out who you are or who is backing you. All you need to remember is that the person who slapped you today is Philip Clarke, Wynn's husband!\" His words hit Yasmin's heart like a thunderous blow. She was</p>  <p id = > extremely unhappy and angry! This good-for-nothing dared lay hands on her! \"Just you wait! I will get someone to kill you now!\" Yasmin trembled all over and took out her phone to call Derrick Hall. \"Honey, come get me now. I was hit by someone in the company, oooooo...\" Yasmin burst into tears on the phone. Derrick Hall stormed out of the office at that moment.</p>  <p id = > When he heard that he was immediately furious and said angrily, \"What?</p>  <p id = > You were hit! Yasmin dear, I will come now! No matter who it is, I will break his hands, make him kneel down, and make amends to you!\" After she hung up the phone, Yasmin's mouth throbbed. She stared at Philip and Wynn and said, \"You are as good as gone, my boyfriend will come over now. He is the chairman of this company!\" Wynn was also panicking, she had not expected that Philip would have hit Yasmin and was not fast enough to put a stop to it. \"VP Lewis, I'm sorry, please allow me to apologize to you. My husband was consumed by his emotions and he doesn't know the severity of the situation. Please forgive him, I sincerely apologize to you.\"</p>  <p id = > Wynn suddenly stood up and bent over to apologize to Yasmin. However, Yasmin was not willing to accept her apology, she said in a nasty tone,</p>  <p id = > \"Wynn, what's the use of apologizing now? Look at my face, look at my bruises. Today, neither you nor your husband can escape!\" When he saw Wynn acting so apologetically, Philip immediately pulled her to his side and said, \"Wynn, don't worry, it's okay, leave everything to me.\" \"But...\" Wynn wanted to say something, but after seeing Philip's eyes, she kept quiet. The weaker one was, the easier it was to bully them. It was Yasmin who was in the wrong, why should he be afraid? Because of a job? Philip stared at Yasmin calmly and said to Yasmin in a frosty tone, \"I hope you don't end up kneeling down and begging for my forgiveness.\" Yasmin laughed arrogantly as soon as she heard it. \"What a joke! Why would I kneel down and beg from a useless scum like you?”</p>  <h2 id =chapter-132 > Chapter 132</h2>  <p id = > Arrogant! Rude! How could a useless bum like him boast so? That was a total joke! Yasmin was unconvinced. She was determined to make Philip pay for what he did, and get that seductress Wynn out of the company! The company was his boyfriend's, which meant that it was hers, too! Yasmin could not tolerate a more beautiful woman to be in the same company and pose a threat to her. Mindy stood next to Wynn. She gazed at Philip as though she was a young girl looking at her idol. 'That was too cool!' Mindy had always wanted her significant other to be as daring and assertive. Even so, she thought that he had acted too rashly. He had assaulted Yasmin Lewis, the vice-president of the company and the chairman's lover. What should she do? Mindy was conflicted. The gears in her brain turned, trying to think up a solution. She sneaked to one corner and discreetly sent a text message to her father. \"Daddy, someone in the company beat up your super adorable and sweet daughter.\" She received a reply very soon. \"Who dares to beat you up, Baby? Daddy will be there to claim his life!\" Who was Mindy Scott?</p>  <p id = > Her identity was a mystery. She never told her colleagues about the special identity of her father. He was Charles Scott, or more commonly known as Second Boss Charles, the second-in-charge after Theo Stuart in the Riverdale criminal underworld! He was a veteran crime lord! However, he was getting old, and his public appearances were getting increasingly rarer.</p>  <p id = > Charles adored his youngest daughter. If anyone dared lay a finger on his treasured daughter, he would kill them even if it meant that the entire Riverdale would be turned upside down! Mindy was relieved when she saw her father's reply. At the same time. Many colleagues were chatting with each other in the office. \"Oh my! That Philip Clarke has gone overboard this time! How dare he beat up Vice President Lewis? He's finished for sure!\"</p>  <p id = > \"That useless bum actually thinks that he's someone important. We'll be in trouble too.\" \"Isn't that so? He should've just kept his head down. I'd like to see what happens to him next. Manager Johnston is finished too.\" They were angry that Philip's reckless actions had caused them unwanted trouble. The chairman would make their life difficult later. At the moment, Yasmin was</p>  <p id = > still furious. She pointed her finger at the couple and yelled, \"I won't forgive you even if you get down on your knees and beg! Especially you, you good-for-nothing, how dare you hit me? I'll break your arms!\" Philip calmly shook his head. 'I don't think she knows what is going to happen to her yet.' Very soon, Derrick arrived at his company. His expression was ice-cold, as though there was a layer of frost on his face. Everyone stayed a polite distance away from him. They knew that the chairman was angry, and he was out for blood. \"You're here, darling. Look at my face, look at what he's done to me! Look at my double eyelids. I did plastic surgery on them and now they're gone!\" When Yasmin saw Derrick arrive, she ran over while twisting her pronounced butt and pushing her chest outward, as though she was the only victim in the incident. Derrick felt sorry when he saw Yasmin's pitiful state. \"Don't cry, darling. I'm here for you. Don't worry, I'll beat up the baddies and restore justice for you!\" Derrick looked around the office and roared, \"Who is it? Stand out now!\" Everyone's eyes fell on Philip Clarke. Derrick could easily see that the culprit was the plainly-dressed man.</p>  <p id = > \"Who do you think you are? How dare you assault someone in my company?\" Derrick spoke forcefully. He had never seen someone as brazen as the guy who had beat up his lover in his territory! \"My name is Philip Clarke. I am Wynn Johnston's husband,\" Philip said calmly. 'Philip Clarke, Wynn Johnston's husband?' Derrick suddenly noticed that something was amiss. He turned to look and saw that Wynn was sitting aside. She had injuries on her face. He knew that Yasmin must have injured Wynn, and Wynn's husband was there to seek revenge. Would he stand up for Wynn though?</p>  <h2 id =chapter-133 > Chapter 133</h2>  <p id = > Of course not. Yasmin Lewis was his woman. The woman that slept with him every night. Derrick chose to ignore what Philip told him. \"I don't care who you are. If you beat up someone in my company, you'll be responsible for it!\" He said with an icy expression on his face. Alas, his judgment was</p>  <p id = > blinded by a woman. He could never imagine that Philip was the mysterious person who had gotten George Thomas to call him. If he had known about that, he would have been on his knees begging for mercy by now. One could not blame Derrick though. Unfortunately, Wynn's husband was renowned as a useless bum. How would a useless bum cause an uproar in his company? Wynn could not believe that the usually reasonable Chairman Hall would act like that. He had asked Philip to take responsibility without investigating the issue. She was livid. She was about to stand up when she noticed Philip winking at her. Wynn discreetly sat back down. Philip calmly turned his head and looked at Derrick. \"So, you're the chairman of Beacon Pharmaceutical?\" Derrick nodded gallantly and stuck out his potbelly.</p>  <p id = > \"That's right, I am Derrick Hall. Don't think that I'll let this slide just because you're Manager Johnston's husband. Yasmin is the VP of the company, and it is unacceptable that you beat her up. There is only one way out of this.</p>  <p id = > First, beg Yasmin for her forgiveness. Then, compensate for her medical fees.\" After Derrick finished speaking, he discreetly glanced at Wynn. A man like Derrick Hall would naturally have feelings for Wynn Johnston, who was a woman ripe for the picking. 'Why did that woman marry a useless bum?\" Yasmin stood up and pointed a finger at Philip's face. \"Get him to kneel down and apologize! I want to slap him ten times!\" Yasmin was still furious about what happened earlier. Not only was she beaten up, but it was done so in front of everyone in the company. She could not take it lying down. \"Alright, darling, I'll listen to you. [I'll get him to kneel in front of you and then you can slap him ten times],\" Derrick said with an eager smile.</p>  <p id = > He did not think highly of Philip at all. However, he was still sympathetic to Wynn. \"However, Wynn Johnston is the manager of our marketing department. Would it be OK if you forgive her?\" Was he still trying to court Wynn? Mindy pursed her lips. \"Human scum!\" She muttered under her breath. Wynn also furrowed her brows. Yasmin was surprised. She was not Derrick's favorite after all. However, she was an opportunist, and she knew that she ought to give some leeway to Derrick. \"Alright, but Wynn has to</p>  <p id = > apologize to me,\" she said coldly. Derrick nodded. He turned to look at Wynn and spoke with the air of the chairman of a company, \"Let's settle this once and for all, Manager Johnston. Just apologize to VP Lewis, then your husband can kneel down and slap himself in the face ten times. I don't need you to compensate for the medical fees. I know that you can't afford it anyway. What do you think?\" How moving! Derrick smiled smugly. He thought that Manager Johnston would be grateful to him for the solution.</p>  <p id = > After all, her husband was a useless piece of trash, which was why he did not consider his feelings. However, Wynn's reaction was beyond his expectations. Wynn could not take it anymore. She stood up and said coldly,</p>  <p id = > \"Chairman Hall, let this be my formal resignation notice! VP Lewis is the one at fault here. I'm not going to apologize to her! It's even more impossible to ask my husband to kneel to her!\" Derrick was surprised that Wynn bit back at him. \"You ought to think through this, Manager Johnston. If you quit your job, do you have an income? Is your useless husband able to sustain you? Don't forget that you have a daughter who needs an operation,\"</p>  <p id = > Derrick threatened her. He did not want Wynn to quit. That would have decreased his chances of claiming her as his. Philip stood up and smiled calmly. \"You don't have to worry about my daughter, Chairman Hall. You ought to worry about yourself.\" Derrick was instantly furious. \"Who do you think you are? Is it your turn to speak? Quickly kneel down and apologize to Yasmin. Otherwise, I'll get someone to ruin you!\" 'How dare that Philip Clarke talk to me like that? That is absolute impudence!' He was the chairman of a company, while Philip was only a delivery man. The difference between the two people was like heaven and earth. \"That's right, he's useless but he talks so big! You ought to avenge me and teach him a lesson that he'll remember for the rest of his life!\" Yasmin added fuel to the fire. However, Philip replied calmly. \"I hope you'll still be able to speak like that after what I'm about to show you, President Hall.\" He took out his phone, opened a video, and put it in front of Derrick's face.</p>  <h2 id =chapter-134 > Chapter 134</h2>  <p id = > Immediately, the intimate sounds of a man and a woman could be heard in the video. The woman was especially loud and dramatic. Derrick was shocked when he saw the video. What followed was raging anger! He could see that the woman in the video was none other than Yasmin Lewis, his lover for a year! Furthermore, she looked like she enjoyed it very much.</p>  <p id = > More so than when she was in bed with him! Yasmin was also dumbstruck!</p>  <p id = > She looked at the video with ever-increasing incredulity. \"That's not me, darling. That's definitely not me. It's a fake video! It's edited!\" She shook her head and tried to argue. Yasmin was very flustered and afraid! Slap!</p>  <p id = > Derrick slapped Yasmin in a fit of rage. \"I've spent a few million on you, Yasmin Lewis, and you sleep with another man behind my back?\" Utter humiliation! Derrick Hall was played a cuckold. Furthermore, the entire company now knew about it. Yasmin was panicking. She covered her face, though that did not stop tears from flowing down her cheeks. \"Listen to me, darling, I swear that I didn't do that. The video must be fake! Fake!\" After that, she turned around and roared madly at Philip. \"You've framed me, Philip Clarke. I'll kill you!\" She tried to grab Philip's phone. Philip shoved Yasmin away and said coldly, \"You should know yourself whether the video is real. I believe Chairman Hall knows very well either.\" Needless to say, Derrick knew. He lifted his hand and slapped Yasmin again. \"We're over, Yasmin Lewis. You are also fired. Get out of my sight now!\" Yasmin was not going to leave just like that. Derrick was her cash cow that she did not want to let go of. Without another word, Yasmin kneeled on the floor and begged for forgiveness. \"I won't do it anymore, darling. I won't do it anymore. That day… that day, I drank a little too much, and that was how it happened. Please believe me that I won't do it again. Forgive me just this one time.\" In that way, she had inadvertently admitted to having an affair.</p>  <p id = > Derrick was more furious than ever. At that moment, he did not care whether beating women was wrong. He lifted his foot and stamped it at her chest</p>  <p id = > while pointing outside the door. \"Get lost now! Get lost!\" He roared. What a shameful scene. He had outed himself as a cuckold in front of all the workers of his company. Derrick could not take it anymore. Yasmin was crying loudly. She gritted her teeth resentfully and pointed angrily at Wynn.</p>  <p id = > \"It's all because of you, you cheap b*tch! You're the one who did this to me!\" She dared not provoke Philip and therefore channeled her anger at Wynn. She rushed over, picked up a vase, and smashed it at Wynn. That happened too quickly! Philip pounced forward, lifted his arm, and blocked the attack. The vase shattered into pieces on Philip's wrist. A big gash appeared on the back of Philip's hand. Blood flowed freely from it. It looked very painful. Wynn's eyes grew wide. She hurried over and looked at Philip's hand that was covered in blood. Wynn was livid. She turned around and slapped Yasmin's face. \"This one's from me!\" She said angrily. Slap!</p>  <p id = > Another slap on her face! \"This one's for my husband!\" Wynn wrapped up Philip's wound with a napkin. She picked up her handbag and took Philip away from the company without looking at Derrick. In the small clinic on the street. Wynn accompanied Philip to dress his wound. \"How is it, does it hurt?\" She said concernedly. \"I'm fine, it's just a small wound. How about you though, are you still angry?\" Philip said with a grin. Wynn's brows were fraught with worry. Her face was still slightly swollen. She recalled the scene earlier. Philip had arrived like divine intervention to save her. Her heart was still throbbing hard. She had not felt like that for a long time.</p>  <p id = > Wynn shook her head and smiled. \"I'm fine. Thank you for just now.\"</p>  <p id = > \"You're my wife. You don't have to thank me,\" Philip said. Wynn rolled her eyes at him and pinched his waist. \"What a slicker. By the way, where did you get that video?\" Wynn did not understand how Philip got his hands on Yasmin's video. Philip thought for a while and explained, \"She bullied you yesterday. I asked Mindy if she had any dirt on her, and she told me about it. You also know that I have a classmate that works in a bar. We chatted for a bit and I found out from him that Yasmin goes around sleeping with other men. That was how I got the video.\" Wynn nodded but did not fully believe</p>  <p id = > him. However, she did not think it was appropriate to ask him any further questions.</p>  <h2 id =chapter-135 > Chapter 135</h2>  <p id = > After they left the clinic, Wynn brought Philip to a cafe nearby and ordered two cups of coffee. \"Philip, now that I've lost my job, what should we do?\"</p>  <p id = > She said worriedly. Earlier, she had resigned from her job on an impulse.</p>  <p id = > She was beginning to regret it. Beacon paid her rather well, and they needed money urgently. Philip shrugged. \"Don't worry, I'm still here. I'll make sure that you and our daughter won't starve,\" he said calmly. \"Should I go talk to Chairman Hall?\" Wynn asked him, blinking. That was one of the very few times she asked for Philip's opinion. She had this impression that Philip had changed. Somehow, he became more dependable and made her feel safe. \"I think that your Chairman Hall will give you a call soon. He'll be begging you to go back to work,\" Philip said calmly. Wynn was surprised, then rolled her eyes at Philip. \"That's just your imagination. Didn't you see just now that I told him I quit in front of his face? \"Whatever. I'm not going to dwell on it for too long. I'll just go find another job.\" Philip was silent for a while. \"Tell me, Wynn, do you like working in that company?\" \"I like it. My colleagues are nice to me,\" Wynn said. She continued talking about her experiences in the company. Philip listened to her attentively. He then excused himself to go to the washroom and made a call there. Soon, Henry Turner's voice was heard over the phone. \"What can I do for you today, Mr. Clarke?\" \"You can proceed with discussing the collaboration between Turner's Hospital and Beacon. Remember, you only want to negotiate the terms with Wynn Johnston,\" Philip said calmly. \"Don't worry, Mr. Clarke. I'll arrange for that,\" Henry said courteously. After Henry ended the call, he wanted to get one of his subordinates to carry out the order, but after thinking about it, he decided to give a call himself to the chairman of Beacon Pharmaceutical.</p>  <p id = > Derrick Hall was currently seething in his office. His lover was caught in an affair, and the manager of his marketing department had just resigned. 'What</p>  <p id = > the hell is going on today?' At that time, his phone started ringing. Derrick answered the phone and said angrily, 'Who the hell are you? I told you before, no salesmen! I'm not interested in buying new houses or personal loans!\" \"Chairman Hall? I'm Henry Turner, not a salesman.\" A voice boomed over the phone. Henry Turner? Derrick sat up in alert. He stood up from his chair and said apologetically, \"Prof… Professor Turner?\" For the past few days, the collaboration between Beacon Pharmaceutical and Turner's Hospital was the only thing in Derrick's mind. He could not believe that Professor Henry Turner, the luminary of the medical world, had called him personally. \"I'm sorry, I'm so sorry, Professor Turner, I didn't know it was you. I've been pestered by salesmen recently and it's been driving me crazy,\" Derrick explained hastily, \"Why did you call me though, Professor Turner?\" Henry did not beat around the bush. \"After doing my research on the various pharmaceutical companies in Riverdale, I've decided that Turner's Hospital shall collaborate with Beacon.\" 'Collaborate with Beacon?' Derrick nearly jumped with excitement! He did not expect that his dream collaboration would fall on his lap. Was this finally a fortunate turn of events? \"Are you serious, Profession Turner? Are you really going to collaborate with us?\" \"Of course, but there's a condition to it.\" \"Just speak whatever condition you may have. It is my honor to be able to collaborate with Turner's Hospital.\" Derrick could not hold back his excitement. \"I can only negotiate the terms of this collaboration with Wynn Johnston from your company, and I can only sign the contract with her,\" Henry said. \"Of course, we'd like to get the contract signed today if possible. Otherwise, we might go and look for another company.\" 'Wynn Johnston?' Derrick was stunned.</p>  <p id = > However, he instantly agreed to it. \"Alright, alright, Professor Turner. I'll inform Manager Johnston right now.\" After the call ended, Derrick was worried. 'Why does Henry Turner only want to sign the contract with Wynn?</p>  <p id = > 'Unless… he knew Wynn personally? 'Oh no! 'Wynn had resigned just earlier!' Sweat streamed down Derrick's forehead. He quickly gave Wynn a call. Meanwhile, back in the cafe, Wynn's phone started ringing just as</p>  <p id = > Philip returned to his seat. She saw that the call was from Derrick and was reluctant to pick it up. Philip smiled. \"Why don't you answer it? It might be good news.\" Wynn furrowed her brows but answered the call anyway. \"Is there anything else, Chairman Hall?\" \"Where are you, Manager Johnston?</p>  <p id = > Do you think we can meet up and talk?\" Derrick sounded incredibly anxious. It was a chance in a lifetime to collaborate with Turner's Hospital.</p>  <p id = > He did not want to miss the chance. \"I'm sorry, Chairman Hall, but I've already resigned from the company,\" Wynn said coldly, \"There is nothing between us to talk anymore.\" Wynn prepared to hang up after saying that.</p>  <p id = > \"Don't, don't! Manager Johnston!\" Derrick shouted, \"Please listen to me!</p>  <p id = > \"How about this, I'm offering you the post of vice-president. Of course, your salary will be adjusted to fit your new position too. I'll also take out one million from my pocket for Mila's medical funds. How about that?\" Derrick tried to tempt her. \"What's going on, Chairman Hall?\" Wynn was surprised.</p>  <p id = > Derrick became more worried than ever. \"How about this, Manager Johnston. Let's meet up somewhere and we'll talk.\" Wynn thought about it for a while and eventually told him where she was. After she ended the call, she exhaled deliberately, then looked at Philip confusedly. \"Philip, do you know, Derrick is asking me to go back. He offered the vice president's post to me.\" Philip smiled and pretended to be excited. \"That's good news! Mila and I will be depending on you from now on.\" Wynn looked at him with mock anger. \"Why did it turn out that way?\" Philip sipped his coffee. \"Do you want to know?\"</p>  <h2 id =chapter-136 > Chapter 136</h2>  <p id = > Wynn was bewildered that Derrick suddenly contacted her and even offered to promote her to vice president. \"You know?\" Wynn asked doubtfully.</p>  <p id = > 'What would Philip know? He's not employed in Beacon, and he doesn't know Derrick.' Philip grinned. \"Maybe he had a pang of conscience over what he said to you earlier, and he genuinely wants to apologize.\" Wynn rolled her eyes at him and said nervously, \"Don't joke around, I'm talking</p>  <p id = > serious business here. He'll be coming here soon. What do you think I should do?\" Wynn was worried about accepting the offer to become vice president.</p>  <p id = > After all, not everyone deserved to sit in that chair. \"Don't worry, I'm here for you. I'll bust his pig head open if he does something stupid to you,\" Philip said exaggeratedly. Wynn chuckled. Her eyebrows were curved and she looked very sweet. For a brief moment, Philip was transported back to the times when they were in school. Pure, innocent, and sweet. Derrick arrived at the cafe a while later. He was panting and his forehead was covered with sweat. \"Oh, Manager Johnston, I've looked everywhere for you,\" Derrick sat down without invitation and flashed a diplomatic smile on his face.</p>  <p id = > When his eyes glanced at Philip, they flashed with mockery and condescension. Derrick hated Philip for what happened at the office earlier.</p>  <p id = > If not for Philip, he would not have been outed as a cuckold in front of his employees. \"Alright, Wynn, we'll be talking about some important company matters. Can all the unrelated people stay out of this conversation?\" Derrick looked at Philip arrogantly. Wynn was surprised. She looked at Philip, though before she could open her mouth, Philip said, \"Don't worry, Honey, I'll just be waiting over there. Call me if you need me.\" Wynn nodded and watched Philip leave. After Philip left the scene, Wynn pulled a long face and said coldly, \"Now can you speak truthfully, Chairman Hall? If there's nothing else, I'd like to leave as well.\" Derrick was instantly anxious.</p>  <p id = > \"Alright, Manager Johnston, I'll get straight to the point then. Do you know Professor Henry Turner?\" Wynn was surprised. She nodded. \"I know, he's the director of Turner's Hospital. He's renowned internationally.\" She knew Professor Turner very well. She also knew that he quite respected her husband. Was the matter related to him? Derrick smiled. \"It's like this.</p>  <p id = > Earlier, Professor Turner called me and told me that Turner's Hospital wants to collaborate with our company.\" \"That's good news. Let me congratulate you in advance, Chairman Hall,\" Wynn said with a smile. \"I wish it were that easy. Don't you know, Professor Turner gave a condition to the collaboration.\" Derrick stopped speaking, took a sip of his coffee, looked at</p>  <p id = > Wynn's confused face, and continued, \"Their condition is, you can only be the only representative on our behalf in the negotiations.\" \"Me?\" Wynn was surprised and confused. 'What's going on?' Derrick continued, \"I don't know the exact details, but Professor Turner mentioned your name. He says that he will only negotiate with Wynn Johnston. So that's why I'm here asking for your help, Manager Johnston. Please come back to work, if only for the fact that you've been in the company for so many years. I'll promote you to vice president. I'm relying on you for the success of the negotiation, Vice President Johnston. What do you think?\" Derrick was extremely worried.</p>  <p id = > He needed to confirm the collaboration with Turner's Hospital today.</p>  <p id = > Derrick noticed that Wynn was hesitating, and continued to make more promises. \"So what do you think, Vice President Johnston?\" Derrick looked at Wynn expectantly. Wynn was silent for a while. Her eyes fell on Philip standing outside the cafe. 'Don't tell me it's him?' After all, Professor Turner was acquainted with Philip. \"Your request is a little too sudden, Chairman Hall. I'll have to discuss this with my husband,\" Wynn said apologetically.</p>  <p id = > Derrick was surprised. He looked doubtfully at Wynn and shot an impassive glance at Philip. 'Why does she have to talk to that useless bum?' However, Derrick did not voice his thoughts. He forced a smile and continued speaking, \"Alright, but please give me an answer soon, Vice President Johnston. I'll reserve the position for you.\" Derrick was as honest and sincere as he could be. Wynn nodded, took her handbag, and left the cafe.</p>  <p id = > She walked next to Philip and tilted her head toward him. \"Philip Clarke, are you responsible for Turner's Hospital's decision to collaborate with Beacon??\" It was a direct question. Philip tilted his head over and grinned.</p>  <p id = > \"Do I look that capable? I happened to mention it in front of Professor Turner once. Why, does he really intend to collaborate with your company?\"</p>  <p id = > Wynn did not suspect the white lie that Philip told her. Even if her husband was acquainted with Professor Turner, Professor Turner should not have been influenced by it when making his decision. Professor Turner must have</p>  <p id = > done his research and decided that Beacon was the best choice. Philip should not have anything to do with it.</p>   <h2 id =chapter-137 > Chapter 137</h2>  <p id = > \"Mm. Turner's Hospital wants to collaborate with Beacon, but the condition is that they will only negotiate with me,\" Wynn said hesitantly. She lifted her head and looked at Philip, \"So, what do you think? Should I accept it?\"</p>  <p id = > Wynn wanted very much to accept Derrick's offer. After all, she did not want to lose her job. Moreover, Derick had also promised many benefits to her. She was quite satisfied with the offer. After all, she had to sustain her family and daughter. \"I know you don't want to lose your job, Wynn. No matter what you choose, I will support your decision.\" Philip spoke as he draped her arm over Wynn's delicate neck, as though they were a couple in the prime of their youth. Wynn nodded seriously. \"I'll have to treat Professor Turner to dinner one day,\" she said with a smile. \"Alright, I'll arrange it with him,\" Philip replied. After the matter was settled, Wynn agreed to negotiate</p>  <p id = > with Turner's Hospital. Also, true to his word, Derrick promoted Wynn to vice president. Everything seemed to be taking a turn for the better.</p>  <p id = > Meanwhile, back in the Johnston family house, Martha Yates was talking to Charles Johnston about finding a match for Wynn. A stack of photographs from the matchmaker was spread out on the coffee table. They were all photos of elite bachelors. \"Oh, Charlie, look at these handsome boys.</p>  <p id = > They're from good families and their economic qualifications are favorable.</p>  <p id = > \"This one's running his own company too.\" \"Tell me, don't you think that our daughter is so stubborn? She's sticking to that Philip Clarke no matter what I tell her. What's so good about that piece of trash? He doesn't have money or status. Our daughter wouldn't have to suffer if only she would just let him go! \"If you ask me what I think, I think we should come up with a plan so that Wynn will divorce that good-for-nothing Philip!\" The more Martha spoke, the angrier she became toward Philip. Charles was wearing his bifocals reading his newspaper and listening to the news on television.</p>  <p id = > \"I have to say, you ought to worry less. Wynn is an adult now. She has a mind of her own.\" \"What mind of her own? Oh, are you happy that she'll be spending the rest of her life with that useless bum?\" Martha was immediately riled. \"I say, what's wrong with you, Charles Johnston? Why don't you ever care about your daughter Wynn? Is that how you should behave as a father? I was blind to have married you. I'm the one who worries about everything in this household. All you do is to fiddle around with those silly things you pick up from the dumpster.\" Martha glared angrily at her husband. Charles was helpless. He flipped to another page of his newspaper and sighed. \"Alright, alright. I'll listen to you then. Just do whatever you want.\" Martha felt a little better after that. She thought for a bit and said,</p>  <p id = > \"I'll call Aiden. He hasn't visited our house for many days.\" Charles was speechless. He looked at Martha, shook his head, and sighed. Beep beep…</p>  <p id = > No one picked up the call. Martha dialed the number a few times, but no one picked up. \"Why isn't Aiden picking up?\" \"Maybe he's busy. He runs a company after all. Maybe you should call him tomorrow?\" Charles said. In</p>  <p id = > the meantime, the newscaster continued to report the news on the television.</p>  <p id = > \"According to the latest updates received by our channel, Gordon Grant, the director of Splendor Education Group, the biggest educational establishment in the city, has been implicated in a scandal involving tunneling, collusion, instigation, among other crimes. Chairman Grant has been remanded for investigation. \"In other news, Aiden Grant, owner of Stardream Media and son of Splendor Education Group Chairman Gordon Grant, has been arrested for his implication in a sex scandal…\" Thud!</p>  <p id = > Martha's phone fell on the floor. She was utterly dumbstruck! 'How is that possible? 'Aiden is arrested? 'Aiden's father is also arrested?' Martha's dream of having her daughter marry into a wealthy family shattered. Charles shook his head and sighed as he continued watching the news report. Martha could not accept it. She nearly fainted. \"What's going on, Charlie? How could Aiden break the law? He must be framed! No, I've got to call Wynn and ask her.\" Martha was incredibly anxious. If she knew who had framed Aiden, she would fight them to the death. At the same time, the doorbell rang.</p>  <p id = > Wynn and Philip entered the house, carrying presents. \"Mom, Philip bought these for you.\" Wynn was full of smiles as she stepped into the house. She had agreed with Philip to go home to talk to her parents. \"Mother, Father,\"</p>  <p id = > Philip greeted the two elders with a wide grin on his face. He was also prepared for the worst-case scenario. However, Martha was instantly furious when she saw Philip. She rushed over and smacked away the presents in Philip's hands. \"Who let you come in here? Get lost now!\"</p>    <h2 id =chapter-138 > Chapter 138</h2>  <p id = > She was being unreasonable. Philip was nonetheless her son-in-law and had greeted her with sincerity. Martha tossed all of Philip's presents by the doorway and shouted angrily at him, \"If you're still a man, Philip Clarke, then don't take another step into my house. I, Martha Yates, have nothing to do with you. The Johnston family doesn't welcome good-for-nothings like you in the household.\" Martha was currently fretting over what happened to Aiden. She was not happy when she saw that loser Philip Clarke at her door.</p>  <p id = > 'Does he think he deserves to step into my house just because he brought a few presents? 'In his dreams!' Wynn was frustrated when she saw her mother being unreasonable. \"What are you doing, Mom? Philip is here to talk to you,\" she said grumpily. Wynn turned around to pick the items, then brought Philip and sat down inside. Martha thought that it would be inappropriate to reprimand her daughter. She stopped driving Philip out of the house but did not show him any hospitality. \"With him here, it feels like a death in the household. Can't he realize that he's an eyesore?\" She pointed at Philip and cursed. Philip was angry when he heard that. He clenched his fists tightly, and his expression sank. However, Martha was oblivious to all that. She continued cursing, \"Wynn, why did you bring this good-for-nothing back to the house? I don't have anything nice to say to him. It's either you divorce him, or you cut all ties with me and your father. These are the only two options for you. You'd better choose wisely.\" It was not the first time that Martha had acted so ridiculously. Wynn was helpless. Martha was her mother after all, and she did not want to anger her any further. \"Mom, why can't you just listen to the two of us for once?\" She said, frustrated, as she sat next to Philip. She wondered if Martha would ever be able to sit down calmly with Philip next to her. Even if Philip had no money or status, that was not the way to treat one's son-in-law. Martha turned her head away reluctantly. \"There's nothing to talk about. I've already discussed it with your father. You two will have to divorce. We don't want the kid. Your</p>  <p id = > father and I will pay five hundred thousand to Philip. You'll cut all ties with Philip and that bastard child.\" Martha was even more frustrated when she was reminded that Wynn had a daughter. Wynn was supposed to marry into a wealthy family. Having a step-child would lower her status. That was why the Johnston family could not accept the girl. They thought of paying Philip off. The money would be child support. Philip, poor loser that he was, would definitely agree to it. It was a princely sum of five hundred thousand after all. Had he ever seen five hundred thousand in his life? When Philip and Wynn heard that, their expressions became extremely unpleasant. They had planned to discuss it with Wynn's mother, but she did not seem to be in the mood for talking. Philip did not want to beat around the bush. He took out a card from his pocket and placed it on the coffee table. Martha was surprised by that gesture. 'Is that… a bank card? 'Philip Clarke, that useless idiot, why did he take out a bank card? 'Don't tell me there's money inside?'</p>  <p id = > \"Mother, there's one hundred thousand in this card. I have been saving that money for the past few years. It's not a lot, and that might not satisfy you, but I'm sincerely giving to you and Father. You can use it however you want,\" Philip said with a smile. He had prepared that bank card a while back.</p>  <p id = > It had one hundred thousand inside for emergency use. Martha chuckled when she heard Philip say that. \"Are you teasing me, Philip Clarke? You don't look like someone who could save up a hundred thousand. If you have this money, why do you still borrow money from other people? Don't think I don't know that you've borrowed several thousand from Lynn Johnston.</p>  <p id = > You've brought shame to my family, you good-for-nothing!\" Martha gritted her teeth with hatred whenever she was reminded of that shameful episode.</p>  <p id = > She would have been kept in the dark if her younger siblings did not tell her.</p>  <p id = > Wynn spoke on Philip's behalf. \"Why can't you just believe Philip for once, Mom? The money in the card is his savings. He's being sincere toward you and Dad. Please take it.\" Wynn pushed the card in front of Martha. Martha looked at the card. She still had her doubts. 'Hell would freeze over if Philip Clarke actually has one hundred thousand in his account!' However, she had</p>  <p id = > no reason to not accept it, if Philip had willingly given the card to her. She took the card and said matter-of-factly, \"He should have presented the money a long time ago anyway. Philip Clarke has never given us anything for the past three years. Even if there's one hundred thousand in this card, that wouldn't have been enough to replace what he owed us.\" Martha was taking Philip for granted. However, it would be inappropriate for her to keep on dissing Philip. That was why she ignored him after that. The mood in the living room was stifling. The news was reporting about Aiden's arrest again.</p>  <p id = > Martha pointed at the television when she saw that. \"See that, Wynn? Aiden has been arrested. Do you know about that?\" Wynn was shocked as she continued to watch the news report. 'Aiden Grant has been arrested! 'How could it be? That's so sudden! 'Wait a minute… 'That day, at Virtuous Court Restaurant, Philip and Aiden had an argument. 'I think Aiden was uncontactable ever since that day…' That was also the day that Philip told his secret to Wynn.</p>  <h2 id =chapter-139 > Chapter 139</h2>  <p id = > Wynn turned around, looked at Philip, and asked, “Did you do it?” Philip shook his head immediately and replied calmly, “How could it have been me? How am I capable of doing such a thing? You’re thinking too much.”</p>  <p id = > He had almost let the cat out of the bag! Fortunately, Aiden had taken it from the back door the other day. Wynn frowned. She did not think Philip was capable of doing such a thing as well. However, at this time, Martha overheard the absurd conversation that was going on between them. She raised her eyebrows, stared at Philip, and asked, “What? This matter has something to do with you?” Wynn knew if Martha found out about what happened at the hotel the other day, she would most definitely find fault with Philip. Perhaps she might even get them to go through a divorce once again. “Mom, don’t be angry at Philip. This matter has nothing to do with him, “Wynn said. “It’s best if he has nothing to do with it. Otherwise, I’ll be the first to chase him out of the house!” Martha glared at Philip</p>  <p id = > vehemently before turning to Charles with a forlorn look. She said, “Charlie, help and see if you can ask around. What did Aiden do wrong? Is it serious?”</p>  <p id = > Charles sighed helplessly and replied, “Okay, fine, I’ll ask around tomorrow.” “Why tomorrow? Do it now,” Martha ordered. Both Philip and Wynn felt uneasy at this. Martha had never been as concerned about Philip compared to Aiden before. After being seated for a while, Philip and Wynn left. They simply could not stay any longer. Martha ignored Philip completely throughout the time they were there. Once they left, Martha continued to pester Charles to inquire about Aiden’s situation. Then, after getting a reply, Martha quickly grabbed her bag and left the house. She was going to visit Aiden. Additionally, with her passbook on her, she was prepared to withdraw some money and bail him out. If Philip found out about it, he would most probably laugh in amusement. He was truly unfortunate to have a mother-in-law who was so protective of an outsider.</p>  <p id = > At the bank. Martha had just taken out her passbook to withdraw some money when she suddenly remembered that Philip had given her a card.</p>  <p id = > After brief consideration, Martha searched through her bag and took out the bank card. She inserted the card into the ATM but did not know its password. Hence, she called Wynn, “Wynnie, what’s the password for Philip’s card?” Martha was not ashamed at all. Instead, she felt that it was justified. At that time, Wynn and Philip were shopping for groceries at the supermarket. Thus, Wynn asked Philip who was beside her before saying to Martha, “Your birthday.” Slam! The call disconnected. Wynn, with a puzzled look on her face, shrugged helplessly. She said to Philip, “I think my mother has gone to the bank to see how much is in that card.” “Don’t worry, there’s a hundred thousand in there.” Philip smiled. Wynn tilted her head, crossed her arms, looked at Philip curiously, and asked, “Philip, tell me, how much money do you have? Last time, you told me that there’s more than a million in your card.” Philip scratched his head, took out another card from the pocket of his trousers, and said, “The rest of the money is here. I snuck it out when I ran away from home. Do you want to go to the bank and</p>  <p id = > check its balance?” Wynn grabbed the card, held it in her hand, and smiled slyly. “I do want to look at it.” Philip smiled in response. However, when his gaze fell on the card in Wynn’s hand, his eyes constricted. He exclaimed in shock, “F*ck! It’s the wrong card!” It’s over! He was in big trouble now!</p>  <p id = > Philip had mixed up the two cards! The card in Wynn’s hand was the one with a balance of one hundred thousand. On the other hand, the one he had given to Martha was the one that had one hundred billion in it! The card had been given to him by George last time! “I’m finished. It’s over!” Philip did not bother with the checkout as he pulled Wynn along and dashed outside.</p>  <p id = > “It’s bad. We have to find your Mom quickly!” At the same time, Martha happily inserted the card she had into the ATM, entered her birthday, and checked its balance. “Oh, there really is some money in this card. Let’s see how much there is.” Martha could not help but let a smile break out on her face. “One, ten, one hundred, one thousand, ten thousand…” The more she counted, the more ecstatic she became! “A hundred thousand, there’s really a hundred thousand!” “Eh, why are there still so many zeroes?” Martha frowned and her heart started pounding. “This… this is…” She started counting again! “One, ten, one hundred, one thousand, ten thousand, one hundred thousand, one million!” “Ten million!” “One hundred million!”</p>  <p id = > “One billion!” “Ten billion!” “One hundred… one hundred billion!”</p>  <h2 id =chapter-140 > Chapter 140</h2>  <p id = > Martha was dumbstruck! Her breath got stuck in her throat! One… hundred billion?! With a loud thud, Martha fell backward and landed on the ground.</p>  <p id = > Her whole body had begun trembling uncontrollably. Very soon, several people gathered around her as they looked and pointed. “Oh, is she having a seizure?” “Call the emergency number quickly!” “Hurry up and call for someone. This looks serious!” Not long after, the employees of the bank rushed over and helped lift Martha onto a seat by the side. They then performed acupressure on her and gave her some water. Nevertheless, Martha struggled to wake up as her hands trembled. Her eyes were dull</p>  <p id = > when she mumbled, “Hundred… billion.” The onlookers were baffled and had no idea what the old woman was mumbling about. Was she delusional?</p>  <p id = > By this time, Philip and Wynn had rushed over to the scene. They had received a call from one of the bank staff who informed them of Martha’s location. “Mom, how do you feel? Are you alright? Do you want to go to the hospital?” Wynn trotted over and squatted next to Martha, her face full of anxiety. Martha was her biological mother after all. Needless to say, Wynn would be anxious if anything happened to her mother. Philip followed closely from behind, and an obvious frown could be seen on his face. He saw the bank card tightly being clutched by Martha. Additionally, the people around them were murmuring something related to the figure, a hundred billion. Although everyone else was at a loss, Philip knew exactly what had happened. His mother-in-law must have seen the amount in the bank card and fainted from shock. He had to think of a reasonable explanation for the matter. Judging by Martha’s personality, she would most probably argue that the card had been given to her by Philip and would seize it. Martha groaned, and her eyelids fluttered. Then, as soon as she saw Philip, she jumped up. Martha’s eyes were bright as she stared directly at him.</p>  <p id = > Grabbing his hand, she exclaimed excitedly, “Philip, a hundred billion…</p>  <p id = > one hundred billion!” There was one hundred billion in Philip’s card! Was it real? Martha could not believe it. Philip had always been a good-for-nothing. Wynn had not figured it out yet. She stared at Martha and Philip blankly as she asked, “What a hundred billion?” Philip shook his head and calmly replied, “I’m not sure either. Is mother…” Philip had not yet finished his sentence when Wynn understood the gist of it. Hence, Wynn pulled Martha up and asked, “Mom, what’s wrong with you? What a hundred billion?” Martha hummed and took Wynn’s hand in hers. She said excitedly,</p>  <p id = > “Wynnie, the card Philip gave to me, there’s a hundred billion in it!” The world stopped moving! Everything fell silent! Immediately, everyone was dumbfounded. Their gazes fell on Philip, the seemingly ordinary young man. He was dressed shabbily and looked nothing like a wealthy man. A</p>  <p id = > bank balance of a hundred billion, what a joke! How the hell did it make sense! “My goodness. Did I hear right, one hundred billion?” “That old woman must be delusional.” “Ah, let’s go already. She must have just come out of the hospital. Young lady, you’d better send her back quickly. It’d be bad if her treatment is delayed.” The people around them said aloud amongst themselves. Naturally, they did not believe that the card had a ridiculous balance of a hundred billion. Everyone regarded Martha as a lunatic. Even the bank employees shook their heads helplessly before turning around and heading back to work. Martha became agitated and shouted at everyone,</p>  <p id = > “It’s true. I really saw that the card has a hundred billion in it. I’m not lying to you!” Martha was a prideful person. Evidently, she would not allow herself to be treated as a lunatic by everyone. She got up and approached each person, telling them that she had indeed seen one hundred billion in the card. Wynn was distraught. She followed Martha around, trying to persuade her as she held onto her arm, “Mom, stop bothering others. How could there be one hundred billion in the card? You must be mistaken. Let’s go home, okay?” Martha refused and shoved Wynn’s hand away. She trotted toward Philip, looked at him earnestly, and said, “Philip, tell them that you have one hundred billion in your card.” Philip had to know. The card was his; he had to know. However, Philip shook his head helplessly and said, “Mom, what one hundred billion are you talking about? Let’s go home.” “No, no way, I’m not going home. I have one hundred billion! You gave me this card, so the money is mine! One hundred billion!” Martha shouted hysterically before rushing to the counter and saying to the young woman behind the teller, “Hurry up and check its balance for me. Tell them that there’s one hundred billion in here!” The bank teller was at a loss. She looked at Philip and said coldly, “Sir, please take her away. We have other customers to serve.” ‘How could they bring a mental patient out?’ Philip pulled Martha aside and said, “Mom, let’s do it this way. You sit there and take a rest. I’ll check the bank account’s balance, okay?” Martha nodded.</p>  <p id = > She was now very flustered.</p>  <h2 id =chapter-141 > Chapter 141</h2>  <p id = > At this time, Wynn came over to help Martha was still trembling to walk.</p>  <p id = > Together, they made their way to the resting area in the corner of the room and took a seat. Philip frowned, took out the card, and passed it over the counter. He said calmly, “Please ask your manager to come out.” The young lady at the counter was taken aback before she sneered. “Sir, do you really think there’s a hundred billion in that card?” What a joke. After the old lady was a young man. Was the whole family full of lunatics? However, Philip smiled faintly, “Then, I’ll withdraw the money.” The young lady looked at him in disdain as she mumbled under her breath, “So poor, yet he still wants to withdraw money. He really thinks he has a hundred billion!” The young lady accessed the bank’s system as she complained. She instructed in an unfriendly manner, “Key in your password.” Philip obliged. The young lady continued to operate the system. However, when she saw the balance of the card, she stood up in shock while her jaw dropped to the floor! The disdain and contempt on her face were quickly replaced with surprise and incredulity! At the same time, the other employees behind the counter began to crowd around her. When they saw the card’s balance, they were all astounded! There… there really was one hundred billion! The old woman had not been lying! One hundred billion, my goodness! All of them had worked in the bank for several years, but none of them had ever seen so much money! In their small bank branch, they only had tens of millions in the vault! “Sir, please wait for a moment. I will call the manager now.” The young lady at the counter came back to her senses and immediately bent over and bowed to Philip before she quickly staggered her way to the manager’s office. Without knocking on the door, Yolanda Lee barged in,</p>  <p id = > “Manager, something amazing has happened!” Patrick Carson was flirting with his little lover in the office at the moment, and his lover happened to be a bank teller that was on duty. Yolanda had entered without permission and naturally witnessed the two of them. Hence, she hurriedly turned around</p>  <p id = > to leave. Patrick’s face turned cold. He told the female subordinate under the desk to leave before he said coldly to Yolanda, “Yolanda Lee, why are you so flustered? Do you know what Article 17 of the Employee Code is?”</p>  <p id = > Yolanda was now full of fear. She kept her head down as she apologized repeatedly. The other teller on duty put on her clothes, huffed at Yolanda, and left with her head held high. “Tell me, what’s the matter?” Patrick was displeased. He had been interrupted halfway through his fun. Who would not be unhappy under such circumstances? Yolanda hurried to explain,</p>  <p id = > “Manager, there’s a big customer outside with a balance of a hundred billion in his card!” “A hundred billion?!” Bang!</p>  <h2 id =chapter-142 > Chapter 142</h2>  <p id = > Patrick stood up abruptly from his chair. His eyes were wide open and his breathing was rapid. Who could have a bank balance of one hundred billion?</p>  <p id = > Not to mention, that person had shown up at his small little branch! If he could get even a hundred million worth of financial investment, he would no longer have to work throughout the year! Moreover, there was a chance he would get promoted to become a branch president the following year! In the case that this big customer pumped in money into his branch, his performance for the year would skyrocket! It just so happened that a few days ago, during a meeting at the head office, his branch had been specifically criticized for poor performance in terms of customer deposits.</p>  <p id = > They were in last place compared to all the other branches! Patrick had been very troubled by the matter. If it continued, he would be fired as the branch manager! Without thinking twice, Patrick trotted out. “Quick, take me to him!” When he arrived in the lobby and saw Philip for the first time, Patrick hesitated a little. However, once Yolanda confirmed his identity, he immediately greeted him with a smile and welcomed him with stretched out hands, “Mr. Clarke, it’s a pleasure to meet you. Shall we discuss this in the VIP room?” Philip shook hands with Patrick and nodded. Seeing the situation, Wynn walked over immediately with her beautiful brows knitted</p>  <p id = > together. She asked, “Philip, what’s the matter?” It was the manager of the bank, why was he being so polite to Philip? Was there really something wrong with the card that Philip had given to her mother? At this time, Martha had not stopped telling Wynn that there was one hundred billion in the card. Naturally, Wynn did not believe it. If they had that kind of money, Philip would not have kept it from her. However, the bank manager’s attitude was making her doubtful. “Philip Clarke, tell me honestly, how much money is there in that card?” Wynn’s face was cold.</p>  <h2 id =chapter-143 > Chapter 143</h2>  <p id = > Philip hurried to explain, “Wynnie, you’re overthinking it. Maybe there’s something wrong with the card. I’ll be back soon.” Patrick was a smart man and caught on immediately. He said, “Madam, please don’t worry about it.</p>  <p id = > We’ll be back soon. I won’t take up too much of Mr. Clarke’s time.” When Wynn heard his response, she could not say anything else. Hence, she nodded. Philip followed Patrick to the VIP room and took a seat on the cozy sofa while Patrick made him tea. Patrick was still astonished by Philip’s young age. He was a big customer with a balance of a hundred billion after all! The richest man in the country had a net worth of only slightly more than a hundred billion. However, that included the assets of the man’s company. As for Philip, he had a hundred billion in personal savings! It was simply too inconceivable! ‘For him to be so wealthy, he has to be the offspring of a hidden family.’ “Mr. Clarke is so young and talented. I wasn’t expecting you to be so rich. It’s really unexpected,” Patrick said. Sitting next to Patrick was his little lover, the bank teller from the front counter.</p>  <p id = > Nevertheless, Philip turned a blind eye to this. He had met too many women that were of the same kind before. “Manager Carson, I only have one request. In a while, when my mother-in-law and wife ask about this, you shall say that there is an error in the bank’s system. Is that understood?”</p>  <p id = > Philip said calmly. The matter had to be kept a secret. If Martha and Wynn found out about such a large sum of money, the consequences would be</p>  <p id = > unimaginable. It was not something that could simply be exposed. Besides, once Philip’s true identity was revealed, how would he explain it?</p>  <p id = > Moreover, he did not know how many pairs of eyes were stalking him from the dark. How could that woman let him off so easily? What happened back then had that woman’s fingerprints all over it. No way, it was too dangerous!</p>  <p id = > Philip could not afford to reveal his true identity at the moment. “Of course, we will definitely meet Mr. Clarke’s requests.” Patrick nodded repeatedly; his face was full of flattery and respect. He asked, “Mr. Clarke, if you don’t mind, may I know the reason?” Patrick was really curious about Philip’s identity. If he could butter up such a person, it would be akin to him striking the jackpot! “Manager Carson, some things are better left unknown.” Since Philip put it in such a way, Patrick could not probe any further. Seeing Patrick’s reluctance, Philip understood what the former was thinking. When Philip was younger, hundreds of bank managers and presidents would knock on his door every day, begging him to take their deposit and wealth management services; they would all promise him a lot of benefits. This Patrick Carson was no exception, otherwise, he would not have brought him to the VIP room. “Manager Carson, let’s do this. Your bank will keep this a secret for me, and I’ll deposit some money here,” Philip said with a smile.</p>  <p id = > Patrick shuddered. He was still wondering how to broach the subject when Philip beat him to it. Excitement and exhilaration welled up in him. Patrick exchanged a glance with his little lover, his face wrinkled with smiles. Were rich people always so generous? “Mr. Clarke, what are you saying? Such a thing is only expected of us for our customers,” Patrick said as he tried his best to be courteous. Philip nodded and stood up while saying, “In that case, I’ll retract the offer then. I’ll take my leave now.” Patrick was dumbfounded.</p>  <p id = > He was not expecting Philip to be so straightforward. “Please wait a minute, Mr. Clarke.” Patrick quickly stood up and said fawningly, “If Mr. Clarke makes a deposit in this small branch of ours, I’ll be sure to manage it properly.” The corners of Philip’s mouth curled up. In this world, there was no one uninterested in money. After that, Patrick spent a lot of time talking</p>  <p id = > about how much Philip should save, for how long, the interest rates Philip would receive, and so on. In the end, Philip said casually, “Let’s do this.</p>  <p id = > Transfer one billion from this card into your branch and open an account under my wife’s name. The password will be her birthday.” “One… one billion?” Patrick looked at Philip. There was a stunned expression on the former’s face; Patrick was wondering if his ears were playing tricks on him.</p>  <p id = > Goodness! One billion just like that, and under his wife’s name at that! This man is simply too rich!</p>    <h2 id =chapter-144 > Chapter 144</h2>  <p id = > Such a man was simply the prince charming of every woman! His wife was too blissful and fortunate. The bank teller on duty felt envious as jealousy began to well up in her. “Hurry up with the process. I have to go grocery shopping with my wife,” Philip said calmly. Patrick was taken aback.</p>  <p id = > Nevertheless, his face had a bright smile on it as he instructed Yolanda to process the transaction on the spot. Philip only needed to provide them his ID card to authorize the transaction. That was the so-called VIP treatment!</p>  <p id = > One billion in deposits! It was an accomplishment that Patrick never imagined he would achieve in his lifetime! With such an achievement, the following year’s branch presidency would definitely be his! “Mr. Clarke,</p>  <p id = > your wife is very fortunate indeed to have a husband like you,” Patrick complimented. Philip merely responded with a faint smile. After everything was done, he left. When Patrick returned to the main lobby, he explained to Martha, “Auntie, I’m so sorry. There was an error in our banking system just now. There’s only one hundred thousand in this card.” Naturally, the cards had been swapped by Philip. As soon as Martha heard Patrick’s words, she grabbed hold of the latter’s collar and hollered, “Impossible! There’s one hundred billion in it for sure! I counted how many zeroes there were!</p>  <p id = > You’re lying. You must be ganging up together to lie to me. Return the money to me! Give it back! It’s my money!” No one could control Martha’s hysterics. “Auntie, I’m really sorry. There was an error in the bank’s system.</p>  <p id = > I hope you can come to an understanding of our situation.” Of course, Patrick dared not retaliate and had no choice but to allow Martha to pull his shirt collar. “You’re ganging up and lying to me!” Martha pointed toward Patrick angrily, pulled Philip’s hand, and said, “Philip, call the police. The bank is trying to cheat us. I’m sure there was one hundred billion in the card just now!” Philip said helplessly, “Mom, there’s only one hundred thousand in the card. How could there be one hundred billion? It was a system error.</p>  <p id = > The bank has already rectified it.” Martha refused to listen. She pushed Philip away, pointed at him, and shouted, “You, you! You’re trying to cheat me of my money! I don’t have a son-in-law like you! Get lost! That money belongs to me. It’s mine!” Martha’s mood at the moment was very volatile.</p>  <p id = > She refused to believe or listen to anyone. Only with everyone’s help did they manage to persuade Martha. Then, Wynn quickly sent her mother home. On the other hand, Philip went to the supermarket to get some groceries before heading for the hospital to visit Mila. Now that she had a dedicated nurse to take care of her, she was no longer very lonely. When she saw Philip, she called out to him in her voice that was like a baby’s and threw herself into his arms. Philip bent down. His face full of happiness as he bopped her on the nose and asked, “Were you a good girl today?” Little Mila held the doll in her hands as she said with a grin, “Mila has been very</p>  <p id = > good. Sister told me to sleep and eat on time. I did it all.” “Fantastic. Mila is the best.” Philip picked Mila up and played a few games with her. On the other end, Wynn returned to the bank and found Patrick. She asked,</p>  <p id = > “Manager Carson, tell me, was there only one hundred thousand in that card?” For some inexplicable reason, Wynn felt that Philip had lied to her.</p>  <p id = > When they were in the bank a while ago, she clearly noticed the reactions of several bank tellers. Additionally, one of them even went looking for the manager in a panic. They must have seen something out of the ordinary to have become so flustered. Patrick said apologetically, “Miss Johnston, there really was only one hundred thousand in the card. It was an error in the system. We have already reported the matter to the head office.” Wynn nodded with her brows furrowed. She had to be overthinking things. Two days later, Juan called Wynn and invited her along with Philip for dinner.</p>  <p id = > Juan said that they should deal with the relationship between the three of them properly. Wynn told Philip about the matter, and the latter immediately replied, “Of course we should go. Why not? You’re my wife after all. Why should I be afraid that he’ll take you away from me?” Wynn did not actually want to go. She was aware of the relationship between Philip and Juan, and she felt awkward about it. However, since Philip was of another opinion, she did not refuse. It was true that the three of them should have a good talk.</p>  <p id = > In the evening, they met at the agreed venue, Concord Hotel. It was a distinguished five-star hotel in Riverdale that regularly hosted music performances, had spa salons, massage centers, and so on. Philip and Wynn entered the hotel and gave the person at the counter their private room number. Then, a dedicated waiter led them inside. At the very same time, two members of the society appeared in the lobby. “Mr. Parker, they have just arrived. Shall we begin?” One of them, wearing a black T-shirt, spoke into his phone. The person’s body was full of tattoos, and he had a wicked look on his face. Additionally, the person’s gaze was locked on Wynn’s back.</p>  <h2 id =chapter-145 > Chapter 145</h2>  <p id = > At this time, Juan was in the private room. He held the phone in his hand with a cold expression on his face and said, “Make sure nothing goes wrong.</p>  <p id = > Otherwise, you won’t get a single cent!” Juan had prepared for this very night for a long time. He would not allow anything to go wrong. He had to take Wynn away and get rid of Philip tonight! “Mr. Parker, don’t worry.</p>  <p id = > With me, Al Hopper, everything will go smoothly.” Lewd laughter was soon heard from the phone. Juan frowned and said coldly, “Just do your part and don’t bother about anything else.” He did not like Al’s tone. The guy was famous for being a pervert, but Juan had to use him because of how reliable he was. At this moment, the door to the private room was pushed open. Soon after, Philip and Wynn entered. Juan quickly hung up the phone, stood up, and greeted them cheerfully, “Wynn, you’re here.” When Juan saw Philip, the smile on his face froze. He said icily to Philip, “Philip, just take a seat anywhere. There’s only the three of us here tonight.” Philip and Wynn took their seats and the atmosphere in the private room quickly became very awkward. Juan poured wine for the two of them and said with a smile, “Ever since graduating from university, I think this is the first time we’re having a meal together.” Wynn said emotionally, “Yes, it has been three years. Yet, we can still sit and eat together like this.” Women were emotional creatures; what Wynn said was very true indeed. Philip was indifferent. He sat beside Wynn and crossed his arms calmly, watching Juan’s performance. Philip did not know what Juan had planned. Nevertheless, he did know that Juan was not the type of person who gave up easily. “Wynn, Philip, here, let’s have a toast.” Juan held his glass up. Seeing Philip’s hesitance, Juan smiled and said, “Why, Philip, you can’t still be angry at me, right?” Wynn glared at Philip, kicked him under the table, and signaled to him with her eyes.</p>  <p id = > Philip thought for a moment before raising his glass toasting with the two of them. During the meal, the chat mainly revolved around their time in college which was nostalgic and enviable. Halfway through the</p>  <p id = > conversation, a waiter interrupted them out of the blue said that someone was looking for Wynn in the main hall. Hence, she was led outside. Shortly after, Juan exited the room as well, claiming that he was going to check out the situation. Consequently, Philip was left alone in the private room. At this time, a tall woman with big curls and high heels came into the room. At first glance, it was obvious that she was a frequent visitor of nightclubs. As soon as she entered the room, she closed the door behind her, threw her handbag to the side, and approached the dazed Philip directly. “Miss, are you sure you’re in the right room?” Philip was a little confused. However, what happened next gave Philip a foreboding that it was a trap! The woman simply straddled Philip and kissed him! Philip was dumbfounded. What the f*ck was happening? Philip pushed the woman off him roughly. The woman was not pretentious. Instead, she got up, took a seat on the sofa, and calmly began smoking her cigarette. Then, before Philip could react, the door of the private room was kicked open! Immediately, a few sturdy and heavily-tattooed men rushed in and blocked all the possible exits. Philip squinted and instantly realized what was happening. The woman on the sofa then rushed over to one of the men. Her clothes were disheveled as she started crying and sobbing, “Big Al, you must seek justice for me. Just now… he almost forced himself on me.” Entrapment! It was a honey trap! Philip immediately understood that it was a trap that had been set especially for him! Even with his toes, he could have guessed who was behind it. Juan Parker, that despicable b*stard! The leading tattooed man, Al Hopper, kicked Philip viciously on the chest and cursed fiercely, “F*cker! You dare touch my girl! Do you want to die!” Philip looked around coldly. The door and windows were blocked. There was no way out. He said coldly, “I didn’t touch your girl. She came in on her own. I didn’t do anything to her.” At this time, many people gathered outside the room; each of them was trying to take a peek inside as they craned their heads. Al raised his voice,</p>  <p id = > “Everyone, come and have a look. This brat got horny and pulled my girlfriend into his private room. He was ready to force himself on her but he</p>  <p id = > claimed he didn’t do anything. So, are you saying that the lipstick marks on your mouth and face were smeared by my girlfriend?” Immediately, the onlookers began talking amongst themselves. “Who’d expect such people to be in Concord Hotel? That guy is dressed so shabbily. Not to mention, he’s full of dirty thoughts!” “This matter should be reported to the police!”</p>  <p id = > “It’s so disgusting. Why don’t we pull him out and parade him on the streets? Remove his clothes and throw him onto the street!” For a while, the crowd was enraged.</p>  <h2 id =chapter-146 > Chapter 146</h2>  <p id = > Upon hearing the unpleasant words of the crowd, Philip’s face darkened along with his frown. Al was extremely annoyed with Philip’s indifferent and innocent look. Hence, he kicked him again, pointed at his nose, and said viciously, “D*mn brat, couldn’t you have found another woman? There are so many women in the red light district, but you touched mine instead. Are you trying to court death!” Philip’s eyes were full of daggers. He glared at the sobbing woman next to Al and said coldly, “Tell them that you’re the one who broke into the room!” Tears were running down the woman’s face as she cried miserably. She pointed at Philip and retorted, “Big Al, he’s spouting nonsense. He couldn’t stop staring at my legs just now and said...</p>  <p id = > he said my *ss is perky and would love to get on with me. When I was in the bathroom, I wasn’t expecting him to pounce on me and grab me from behind. He then dragged me into this room. I… I was nearly…” “You’re still trying to put on an act?” Al fumed and a slap landed on Philip’s head as the former shouted, “F*cker! You’re finished! I’ve called the police. Just sit here and wait to be arrested!” At this time, Juan finally returned with Wynn in tow. Upon coming across the scene, Juan appeared to be very surprised as he asked, “Philip, what’s wrong? What happened here?” Wynn was very anxious. She had heard the commotion, saw the scene in the private room, and overheard the comments of the surrounding people.</p>  <p id = > Consequently, her eyes were now red. “Philip, what did you do?” Wynn</p>  <p id = > rushed in and grabbed Philip’s arm. Philip said hurriedly, “Honey, you must believe me. I was framed. I don’t know this woman. They’re ganging up against me.” Al taunted immediately, “You have a wife, yet you still dared to touch my woman!” “Hey, lady, this husband of yours is a pervert! He pulled my girlfriend into this private room and was going to force himself on her!” Wynn became flustered when she heard this. She turned around immediately and apologized, “I’m really sorry about this. My husband wouldn’t do such a thing. It has to be a misunderstanding.” Wynn did not believe that Philip would do such a thing. Al pushed his woman aside and bellowed at Wynn, “Are you saying that I’m lying? Can’t you f*cking see the lipstick marks on your husband’s face? Are you saying my girlfriend tried to seduce your husband?” Wynn shrank in fear. Al was too fierce.</p>  <p id = > Nevertheless, Wynn apologized and said, “I believe in my husband. He wouldn’t do such a thing. There has to be a misunderstanding.” “The hell with your misunderstanding!” Al was furious and had raised his hand to slap her. However, his hand was firmly caught by Philip’s in mid-air, “Don’t touch my wife!” The corner of Al’s eyes froze. He was a notoriously ruthless person with a strength that was hardly matched. Hence, he was not expecting his strike to be blocked by an ordinary man. The brat in front of him was a little uncanny. “Hehe, fine, f*cking explain it to the police then!” Al taunted.</p>  <p id = > At the same time, a few police officers walked in. “Who called the police?”</p>  <p id = > the leading square-jawed policeman asked seriously. “Me,” Al said and pointed at Philip. He said with a sneer on his face, “This guy forced himself on my girlfriend, and I caught him in the act. Arrest him quickly!” “Come with us then. All of you too,” the policeman said. “Officer, there must be a mistake. My husband wouldn’t do something like that. There must be a misunderstanding.” Wynn’s eyes were red. She almost broke out in tears when she saw Philip was about to be taken away. “If there’s a misunderstanding, we’ll find out about it at the station.” The policeman handcuffed Philip without further ado. “Please wait!” Wynn tried to stop the policeman but was given a stern warning instead, “Madam, if you obstruct</p>  <p id = > us from performing our official duties, you’ll be arrested as well!” “Wynn, don’t worry, it’ll be fine. I have friends at the station. I’ll get them to help Philip later.” At this time, Juan, who had been watching the excitement unfold from the sidelines, stepped forward. He seemed very concerned.</p>  <p id = > Nevertheless, he was gloating internally and exchanging glances with Al.</p>  <p id = > The two sneered triumphantly at the same time. Philip was doomed this time. He would be locked up for more than a week at the very least. If the matter was exaggerated further, it was not impossible for him to get an attempted sentence. Philip smiled, wiped the tears from the corners of Wynn’s eyes, and said, “Honey, don’t worry. I’ll clear up the misunderstanding and be out very soon.” Philip looked calm on the surface, but he was brimming with anger. He looked at Juan coldly and sneered in his heart. Juan had finally laid his hand on him. Now, he shall bear the consequences. Philip was taken away and brought directly into an interrogation room. During this period, no one came to interrogate him, and he was just locked there. Outside, Al and his men were released before him because they were perceived to be the victims in this case. The police handled it impartially, so naturally, they arrested Philip. That was because the matter had nothing to do with Al and his men! At the entrance of the police station, Al and his men were chatting and smoking while waiting for Juan to come over in his BMW X8. “Mr. Parker, if you require such services again next time, don’t forget to call us.” Al smiled as he hugged the woman wearing a red dress. Shortly after, he left with his men. Juan stared in the direction of the police station with a sneer on his face, “Go against me and you’ll be killed sooner or later.” After Philip was arrested, the entire Riverdale experience an upheaval… “Theo! Something has happened! Mr.</p>  <p id = > Clarke has been arrested!” In the villa, Tiger quickly found Theo.</p>  <h2 id =chapter-147 > Chapter 147</h2>  <p id = > In the villa, Theo was having a discussion with a few of his henchmen.</p>  <p id = > When Nino Gil was uprooted previously, Theo had been unable to swallow</p>  <p id = > such a big piece of cake at one go. Hence, he had to discuss the matter with his brothers. After all, there were too many venues to handle, and they were related to too many interests and connections in the background. At this moment, when Theo saw the panicked Tiger rushing in, he raised an eyebrow and asked, “Why are you so flustered?” “Theo, Mr. Clarke has been arrested.” Tiger was sweating profusely as he spoke, “I just came back and overheard that Mr. Clarke was arrested at Concord Hotel.” Theo stood up abruptly, his face full of anger. “What? How could he have been arrested?” “It seems that he molested a woman and was caught red-handed.</p>  <p id = > However, according to our men, that woman belonged to Al Hopper, a small-time gangster,” Tiger explained. “Al Hopper?” Theo looked puzzled but said domineeringly, “I’ve not even heard of him and he dares to touch Mr. Clarke. He’s seeking death!” Theo’s face turned cold as daggers formed in his eyes. “Bring a few men and take care of this Al guy. Find out who made him do it! Also, call Deaton Wade and tell him to release Mr. Clarke immediately!” Theo knew that if Mr. Clarke was arrested, the whole of Riverdale would experience an uproar! Those people were too brazen! “Yes, Theo!” Tiger acknowledged his orders. Theo also got up hurriedly, left the villa, and drove personally to an unknown location. On the other hand, after Philip was arrested, Wynn stayed with Juan the entire time, trying to think of a solution. “Juan, you must help Philip this time. I’m sure he couldn’t have done such a thing. Those people must have framed him on purpose.</p>  <p id = > I’m afraid Philip is in trouble.” Wynn burst into tears. She was extremely worried about Philip’s situation. Juan comforted her and said, “Wynnie, don’t worry. I’ll try my best to help him. I’ll call my dad, he knows many people.” Wynn nodded as tears poured down her face. Evidently, her eyes were red from all the crying. She could only place her hopes on Juan at such a time. Juan pretended to call his father. When he hung up, his face was gloomy, and he seemed very dejected. When Wynn saw this, her heart sank for a moment, and she quickly asked, “Juan, how is it? Does Mr. Parker have a solution?” Juan sighed and said, “Wynnie, my dad has asked</p>  <p id = > someone to help, but the matter is still very uncertain. It’s estimated that the specific situation can only be clarified by tomorrow.” Wynn was aware that asking for help was not easy. She nodded and said eagerly, “Juan, can you help me contact those people just now? I’ll pay them as much as they want.”</p>  <p id = > Juan fell silent. The more he acted, the more distressed Wynn became. Juan spoke after a long while, “I’ll try.” Unbeknownst to Wynn, Juan was gloating internally. Him, help Philip? Impossible. He could not wait for Philip to be locked up forever. That way, he could get close to Wynn without any constraints, get her, and make her his own! At the same time, in the chairman’s office of the Apex Group. Theo walked in with a sexily dressed secretary that had a hot figure. Looking at George Thomas, who was working at his desk busily, Theo respectfully inclined his body. “Mr.</p>  <p id = > Thomas, Mr. Zander is here,” the secretary announced in her sweet voice.</p>  <p id = > George raised his head, glanced at Theo, and said, “Theo, what brings you here at such a late hour?” Theo was a little nervous and lowered his head as he said, “Mr. Thomas, something happened. Mr. Clarke was arrested.”</p>  <p id = > “Eh?” George was startled. His expression sank, and he said solemnly, “The Young Master was arrested? By whom?” At the same time, the door to the office was pushed open again. This time, Julian Thane rushed in; a panicked expression could be seen on his face. He said, “Mr. Thomas, Mr. Clarke was deliberately framed for molesting a woman and was taken away.” In a split second, the entire office was filled with a biting chill and burning anger!</p>  <p id = > The combination of fire and ice made people feel as if George Thomas was about to explode with an intense aura! “Who did it!” Bang! George was furious as he stood up angrily; his eyes were as wide as copper bells! Theo shuddered in fright and almost lost his balance. He had never felt such fury from George before. All this while, the old man had always been friendly and approachable. “We found out that it was done by a few gangsters who are led by someone named Al Hopper. We don’t know who’s behind it yet,”</p>  <p id = > Julian reported. “Call Deaton Wade and order him to release the Young Master immediately. Also, find out the person who’s responsible for this!”</p>  <p id = > George’s eyes had become narrow while his tone of voice had become chilly. He stepped out of the office, took Julian with him into the elevator, and went straight up to the secret room on the top floor. Naturally, Theo waited in the office below. He was not qualified to go up there with them.</p>  <h2 id =chapter-148 > Chapter 148</h2>  <p id = > On the top floor, in a room several hundred square meters wide, there was a huge electronic display screen. George Thomas bent over from his waist and stood in front of the screen. His stature was respectful as he faced an old man sitting in a wheelchair; the man in the wheelchair had a breathing mask over his face. “Old Master, Young Master is in trouble.” George’s voice was trembling as he spoke. On the screen, the old man merely raised his hand slightly and moved a few fingers. Only then was an old and weak voice heard, “Don’t be too ostentatious. Let Reed handle this matter.” “Yes, Old Master,” George acknowledged respectfully. He paused for a moment before asking, “Old Master, do we need to let Young Master know about the matter with Miss Sommerset?” A moment of silence ensued. The old man sighed and replied, “That girl is simply too arrogant. Let Phil handle the matter on his own, cough, cough…” The electronic screen turned off; George turned around with Julian and left. Riverfront Province, Longman Villa district. A man in his mid-forties that looked prominent could be seen wearing a grey Tang suit and playing chess with a man in his thirties that was in a military uniform. In the vicinity, there were about a dozen men in military uniforms standing inside and outside the villa, guarding every entrance and exit with utmost vigilance. At this moment, another man in uniform hurried over and whispered into the ear of the man in the Tang suit.</p>  <p id = > Crack! The chess piece in his hand was crushed! The man in the Tang suit said coldly, “What the hell is the Riverdale Law Enforcement Bureau doing?</p>  <p id = > They’re randomly arresting people without thorough investigation. Call Deaton Wade and order him to release that person at once!” He was absolutely furious! The entire courtyard was instantly filled with battle-</p>  <p id = > tested, murderous intent! The man in uniform sitting across him asked,</p>  <p id = > “General Williams, what happened?” The man in the Tang suit snorted coldly, pointed at the man in uniform, and said, “The soldier you groomed has grown up to become a fine officer that is now used by others. Do you know who his men arrested?” Reed Williams was very angry, and his whole body was brimming with fury. Riverdale was in disarray! They dared to arrest that person; were they queuing up for reincarnation? “Who?” The man in uniform opposite him frowned. Something serious must have happened for General Williams to be so angry. Reed scoffed. “Philip Clarke.” Slam!</p>  <p id = > The chess piece in the hand of the military-clad man fell onto the chessboard, but it was ignored. He got up abruptly and said, “General Williams, I’ll handle this matter at once.” They were doomed! They actually dared to arrest that person. The men under Deaton Wade were dead for sure!</p>  <p id = > At the same time, in the compound of the Riverdale Law Enforcement Bureau, a square-faced Brian Fuller was seated in his office. Sitting across him was none other than Juan Parker. He took out a box of tea leaves and said with a flattering smile, “Captain Fuller, this is for you. You must face a lot of pressure every day. This is premium Biluochun Green Tea.” Brian glanced at it before waving his hand and saying, “Mr. Parker, please take it back. I can’t accept such a thing.” Juan smiled wryly but did not insist.</p>  <p id = > Instead, he went straight to the point, “Captain Fuller, in your opinion, how should we deal with the matter of my classmate?” Brian looked at Juan with a smile and asked, “Mr. Parker, how do you wish to deal with it?” Juan Parker was visiting him in the middle of the night with expensive gifts in hand. He had to be up to something. Juan smiled and said, “Captain Fuller, I know you’re worried about the school matters of your son. Recently, I saw a house with a balcony in the city center near the school district. I’ve already given the keys to your missus. Perhaps you should give her a call first?”</p>  <p id = > Brian was startled but soon frowned. With his eyes on Juan, he quickly called his wife, “Ada, did you receive keys from someone? Give them back at once!” On the other end of the line, Ada Cox could be heard showing off</p>  <p id = > to her girlfriends that she had just gotten a house in the city center near the school district. When she heard Brian’s words, she retorted, “Why should I give them back? They were given to me! I’m not returning them! You work overtime every day and hardly come home. How many days have you spent with your son? You never bother about his school matters, so why are you yelling at me now? If you’re so capable, why don’t you get a house in the school district instead?” Slam! The call disconnected. Brian’s face was sullen as he stared at Juan. After a long while, he asked, “What do you want?”</p>  <h2 id =chapter-149 > Chapter 149</h2>  <p id = > Juan grinned broadly, leaned back into his chair comfortably, and said leisurely, “I’m not asking Captain Fuller to do anything against the law. Just let him stay inside for a few more days. He has violated the law after all. We are merely enforcing the law strictly and fairly, don’t you think so, Captain Fuller?” Juan chuckled as his face showed an expression of triumphant success. Next to his wife, Brian Fuller was a loser. That was his weakness.</p>  <p id = > Brian considered it for a moment before nodding in agreement. “Okay.” Ten minutes later, Brian finished sorting out the documents. He headed to the director’s office, knocked on the door, and entered the room after getting a response. At the time, Deaton Wade, Director of the Riverdale Law Enforcement Bureau, was busy handling official matters. He was a good public servant of the people, working late hours into the night. “Brian, why are you here so late?” Deaton greeted him in a friendly manner. Holding up his teacup, he blew on it gently before taking a sip. Deaton had a good impression on Brian. He was a strict and meticulous person; a potential talent. Brian walked in with the documents in his hand and said, “Director Wade, a few colleagues and I arrested a suspect who molested a woman tonight. We have completed the investigation and the report is ready. We await further instructions.” Brian passed the documents to Deaton as he spoke. Deaton was taken aback and his expression fell. What was Brian</p>  <p id = > doing, waiting for his instructions on such a trivial matter? Thunk! Deaton put his cup down harshly and said somberly, “Brian, do you have to ask me personally about such a small matter? Are you getting confused?” Brian steeled himself and said, “Director Wade, it may be a small matter but haven’t we been trying to crack down this sort of crime recently? I think we can use this case as an example to propagate the matter. The suspect, Philip Clarke, should be punished and sentenced heavily.” Deaton finally realized his objective. He nodded and said impatiently, “That’s fine, handle it on your own. You don’t have to notify me.” Deaton handed the trivial matter to Brian. After getting the order, Brian left the office. However, as soon as Brian walked away, the phone on Deaton’s desk rang. When the call connected, a courteous voice was heard from the other end of the line,</p>  <p id = > “Director Wade, this is Theo Zander.” “Mr. Zander is calling me so late at night. How may I help you?” Deaton knew that Theo was a very influential person. “Director Wade, I won’t beat around the bush. Just tonight, your men arrested a friend of mine. I hope Director Wade can release this person as soon as possible. There has been a misunderstanding,” Theo said firmly, his tone not negotiable. Naturally, Deaton discerned it. He raised his eyebrows and said solemnly, “Mr. Zander, my men wouldn’t arrest someone for no good reason. If your friend really is innocent, we’ll deal with it impartially for sure. Please don’t worry about it.” “I’m willing to trust Director Wade, but this friend of mine… There has to be a misunderstanding. I hope Director Wade can handle it impartially.” The meaning of Theo’s words was very obvious. Deaton furrowed his brows. He was not satisfied with the other party’s attitude. Theo Zander, he had not yet even touched him and he dared to talk to him in such a manner! “Mr. Zander, we’re bound by the law and evidence. If he really did not do anything, he’ll be released for sure,” Deaton’s tone was cold as he spoke. “Since Director Wade says so, I’ll trust your words. I hope you can deal with it as soon as possible.” Slam! The phone was hung up the moment he finished talking.</p>  <p id = > Fury stirred in Deaton as he slammed the table! Who the hell was Theo</p>  <p id = > Zander to speak to him in such a manner! Over the years, if it were not for Theo’s transformation that made him a well-known entrepreneur that did charitable deeds, Deaton would have arrested him long ago. Nevertheless, Deaton had no evidence to do so. However, Theo now dared speak to him so callously. Who the hell had been arrested? Deaton frowned as he felt uneasiness swallow him. He had a feeling that it was related to the case Brian had just reported to him. Nonetheless, just as he was about to find out personally, his private phone rang. Deaton looked at the display of his phone and immediately felt thrilled. “Hello, Mr. Thomas. It’s my pleasure to hear from you,” Deaton’s tone of voice was full of respect. It was George Thomas, the richest man in Riverdale. Countless people wished to be connected to him. Deaton Wade was no exception. He was the representative of all the entrepreneurs of Riverdale, and to a certain extent, the face of Riverdale itself. “Director Wade, I won’t beat around the bush.</p>  <p id = > Your men have arrested my young master by mistake. I hope Director Wade can find out the truth as soon as possible and release him without further delay,” George spoke with a polite tone, but it was also one that was indisputable. Deaton was truly astounded this time! The… the young master of George Thomas? My goodness! The richest man in Riverdale had a young master? What sort of background did the young master have? “Mr.</p>  <p id = > Thomas, don’t worry, I’ll get someone to check at once. We’ll definitely uncover the facts and evidence related to the matter. It’ll be dealt with impartially, and I’ll give you an answer in a while.” Deaton dared not be negligent. The matter could not be delayed! How could there be so many wrong arrests in one night? What the hell were his men doing? Within his panic, Deaton felt anger as well.</p>  <h2 id =chapter-150 > Chapter 150</h2>  <p id = > “Director Wade, this old man shall thank you then. Next year, I plan to invest in the construction of a police school to support the social development of Riverdale,” George said. Gulp! Deaton was dumbfounded!</p>  <p id = > A police school?! It was shocking! Too astounding! “Thank you for your great support toward our work! I’ll handle the matter personally. Please wait for a moment, and I’ll definitely give you a satisfactory answer!” Deaton hurriedly thanked George before hanging up the phone. He then took a long breath and recovered from the shock. Afterward, Deaton hastily donned his hat and prepared to go out. Apart from excitement, there was also anger! To have randomly arrested the young master of Mr. Thomas, his men were too reckless! At this time, the phone on his desk rang again. Deaton was already very anxious. He grabbed the receiver and asked impatiently, “Who is this?</p>  <p id = > Can’t you call back later?” His tone was extremely unfriendly.</p>  <p id = > Unexpectedly, a cold snort came from the other end of the line. “Fantastic, Deaton Wade, you dare to yell at me now. Have you changed jobs and don’t even know who Reed Williams is anymore?” The person’s tone was icy and laced with anger. Deaton trembled as he looked at the screen of his phone.</p>  <p id = > “General… General Williams? You’re mistaken! Something urgent came up, so I…” “Hmph!” A cold snort was heard from the other end, and Deaton’s eyelids fluttered. Reed Williams, a man as imposing as a huge mountain! It was evident the man had an extremely strong background!</p>  <p id = > Deaton could not afford to be negligent! In the past, when Deaton was just a lowly soldier, he had served under Williams. “I don’t care what urgent matter you have. Today, your men indiscriminately arrested a distinguished guest of mine. You must investigate the matter thoroughly and release that person at once!” Reed said stonily. When Deaton heard that, tingles spread across his scalp! The f*ck! Reed Williams’s distinguished guest had been arrested now? What the f*ck was happening? Deaton had begun sweating profusely. “General Williams, don’t worry. I’ll investigate the matter right away. Give me fifteen minutes, and I’ll definitely give you a satisfactory answer.” “Okay, I’ll give you fifteen minutes! If you return even a minute late, you can take off your uniform yourself!” Reed said angrily. Slam! The call disconnected. Deaton collapsed as his head began to buzz. He was in trouble! Big trouble! Brian Fuller, who the f*ck had he arrested? Deaton rushed outside and told the driver to send him to the police branch immediately. On the way there, he enquired about the situation and found out that only one person had been arrested that night. One person? Theo Zander, George Thomas, and even Reed Williams had intervened on his behalf! He was doomed! What kind of influential power and background did the person have? What the hell had those fools under him done! After getting out of the car, Deaton dashed into the branch immediately. As soon as his subordinates saw him, they all stood at attention and saluted without saying a word. Why? They were not clueless. He was there to question them! “Brian Fuller! Get the f*ck out here at once!” Deaton cursed loudly and kicked the door to the captain’s office open. At this time, Brian was arguing with his wife in the office. He wanted his wife to return the keys, but she refused to do so. Hence, they had started fighting. Brian hung up the phone immediately and hurriedly greeted Deaton with a smile the moment he saw him. “Director Wade, why are you here in person? Did something happen?” Slam! Deaton smacked the table violently, pointed at Brian’s nose, and shouted, “You did such a good job! Where is he? Where did you lock him?”</p>    <h2 id =chapter-151 > Chapter 151</h2>  <p id = > Brian was dumbstruck. He had not expected Deaton to become enraged! He had never experienced such a thing before. As a veteran, Brian knew very well that something had to have happened! Could it be that the young man who had been arrested had a terrifying background?! “Director Wade, what happened?” Brian braced himself. Deaton glared at him and said coldly,</p>  <p id = > “You dare ask me? What a stupid thing have you done? That man, where is he? Bring me to him now!” Brian Fuller was still unaware of the current situation. He had worked for the police force for many years, but he was still so ignorant. Brian knew that Deaton was enraged and dared not delay.</p>  <p id = > Hence, he led Deaton way to the interrogation room. At this time, Philip was calmly resting with his eyes closed in the room. He was not worried at all.</p>  <p id = > He had not done anything wrong. Naturally, someone would take care of the matter for him. He just had to wait in peace. However, Philip was contemplating one thing, and that was how he should deal with Juan Parker.</p>  <p id = > Someone else might not have been able to tell who’s handiwork it was, but Philip was very sure the trap had been set by Juan. Philip had not expected their brotherhood to fall apart at such a moment. Needless to say, the door was soon pushed open, and two men walked in. The one in front was naturally Brian, while the one at the back was Deaton. When Deaton laid his eyes on Philip who had been locked inside, he was puzzled. Such a young man had caused upheaval in three major parties. Nevertheless, he was not someone to be underestimated! “Mr. Clarke, I’m sorry. The matter has been clarified. It’s indeed a misunderstanding. You can leave now,” Deaton smiled and said diplomatically. Brian was startled as he said, “Director Wade, a few colleagues and I clarified the matter. He was caught red-handed. How can we let him go?” If Philip were released, it would be difficult for Brian to explain himself. Nevertheless, Deaton merely glared at Brian grimly, took out his phone, threw it at him, and said angrily, “See for yourself and tell me if we can release him or not?!” Deaton was truly angry this time. Brian had arrested someone indiscriminately without any thorough investigation. Naturally, the arrest was a mistake right from the start. Nevertheless, Brian still would not admit it. The evidence had already been sent to Deaton’s mobile phone! It was a slap to Brian’s face! Brian panicked. He switched on the video and saw the previous victims confessing and earnestly explaining how they had framed Philip. Ba-thump! Brian was dumbfounded. He knew that he had arrested the wrong person. He had made a huge mistake in this case. “Brian Fuller, let me ask you again, can we let him go now?” Deaton hollered. Brian’s face was flushed. Cold sweat was dripping from his forehead as he replied, “Yes, we can.” “Hmph!” Deaton snorted. He then turned to Philip with a smile. “Mr. Clarke, I’m so sorry.</p>  <p id = > On behalf of the bureau, I sincerely apologize to you. I hope you aren’t troubled by this matter. We have learned our lesson from this case and</p>  <p id = > promise it will never happen again!” Philip had not said a word until now.</p>  <p id = > He glanced at Brian coldly before smiling calmly at Deaton. “It’s okay. It’s just a little misunderstanding. I have trust in you.” With a face full of smiles, Deaton led Philip out of the interrogation room personally. “Brian Fuller, you’re suspended for three months. Write me a full inspection report!”</p>  <p id = > Before he left, Deaton chastised Brian who could only accept his fate. After the two left, Brian called Juan and said stonily, “Juan Parker, that person has been released. Do you have any idea what trouble you’ve caused me?</p>  <p id = > Tomorrow, my wife will return the keys to you. Don’t call me any more for such matters!” He was livid! On the other side, Juan was astonished. He had not expected such an outcome. It had been only less than half an hour, and he was already released? “Captain Fuller, what’s the situation? How could he be released just like that?” Juan was puzzled. At this moment, Juan was in his villa. What had gone on with Philip? Why was he being released just like that? “You dare ask me? Do you know who you have messed with?</p>  <p id = > Director Wade came here and released him personally! Those people you found resorted to underhanded means, it’s good enough that I’m not arresting you, but you still dare ask me such a thing?” Brian was infuriated.</p>  <p id = > Juan’s methods were too dirty! “Director Wade released him personally?”</p>  <p id = > Juan got a fright. What sort of background did Philip have for the Director of the Bureau to intervene personally? “Captain Fuller, can you help me…”</p>  <p id = > Juan started speaking, but the call disconnected before he could finish.</p>  <p id = > F*ck! Juan was furious. He dropped his phone and paced back and forth in the living room. Philip was released? What the f*ck was he going to do now? His plan had not even started, and it was already botched?</p>    <h2 id =chapter-152 > Chapter 152</h2>  <p id = > He used another phone and called Al Hopper. The call was only answered after a long while. “Juan, are you surprised that it’s me?” Juan trembled at the familiar voice. His hands and feet turned cold as sweat started to roll down his forehead in beads. “Philip? How did you…” Juan’s words were stuck in his throat. This was Al’s number but Philip was the one who answered the phone. Even a pig-brained idiot would know what was going on. “Where’s Al?” Juan controlled his frantic emotions and asked. “In front of your house,” Philip said calmly. Then, there was a muffled voice coming from the phone. Juan was shocked. He stood up from the sofa and ran to the window, looking outside through the glass. Two black Mercedes-Benzs were parked in front of the entrance of the mansion. Their tail lights were shining in an ominous red glow. There was a man at the hood of the car. He was smoking a cigarette. The red glow of the cigarette caused Juan to panic.</p>  <p id = > Philip! How did he get here so fast? Bang! Before Juan could come back to his senses, the door of the mansion was being opened forcefully. Tiger and ten of his men barged inside instantly. The men in black immediately surrounded the living room. Another loud bang. Al was kicked to the front of the sofa by Tiger. There was a green tape across his mouth. He knelt on the ground with his face bruised and swollen. He looked deplorable.</p>  <p id = > Everything happened too fast. Juan did not even have time to register what</p>  <p id = > was going on. Theo walked in from the door. Philip followed behind him slowly and threw his cigarette butt on the floor. He put out the cigarette with his foot and strode inside. He ignored everyone in the room and walked straight to the sofa to sit down. Then, he looked around the mansion. “I never thought that I’d be visiting your place three years later,” Philip said calmly. Juan was covered in cold sweat. He was shocked by the sight in front of him. Was that not the underground king Theo who was standing respectfully next to Philip? What… What was going on? Rip! Tiger ripped the tape off of Al’s mouth. Al started kowtowing non-stop, begging for forgiveness. He wailed loudly, “Mr. Clarke, please have mercy! Please have mercy on me, Mr. Clarke! Please show some leniency to me, Mr. Clarke! I was wrong! I’ll never do it again. It was all Juan’s idea! He was the one who asked me to do that!” Everyone had survival instincts. When Juan heard that, his eyes went wide as he roared, “Bullsh*t! I don’t even know you!</p>  <p id = > When did I order you around? You’re slandering me!” Juan was not an idiot.</p>  <p id = > Philip’s arrival all of a sudden gave him enormous pressure. Especially now that his house was filled with people. One of them was Theo who was standing beside Philip. This man was respected by everyone no matter where he went. Today, he was willing to stand next to Philip and just watch.</p>  <p id = > It was as if Theo was just a minor character in front of Philip. He did not dare to be presumptuous. As such, Juan was careful. Philip had changed too fast. It was too unexpected! Al was kneeling on the floor and pointing at Juan with all his might. He immediately confessed in front of Philip. “Juan, you gave me 100,000 bucks to do that! “Mr. Clarke, you have to believe me.</p>  <p id = > He gave me those orders. Please let me go. I won’t do it again.” Al was speaking in a tearful voice. He kowtowed heavily on the ground. His forehead was wounded during the process. He was scared to die. These were Tiger and Theo they were talking about. When they stomped their feet, he would be thrown into the river. Philip shifted his eyes and Tiger understood what he meant by that. He brought Al outside. Horrifying screams and pleadings sounded from the outside. It was knocking on Juan’s defensive</p>  <p id = > line. His eyes went cold and his forehead was covered in cold sweat. He kept reflecting on his current situation. He messed up. He did not expect that Philip was not someone ordinary. He had kept this hidden for so long!</p>  <p id = > “Philip, I don’t know you that well. I didn’t think that you’d know Theo,”</p>  <p id = > Juan said while chuckling coldly. “All these years, you’ve been hiding your identity so well.” Even though he was panicking, he was not scared. He was not a pushover. Philip said calmly, “Don’t judge me with your outlook.</p>  <p id = > You’ll never be able to guess my status.” “Really? I’m curious. How can you have a status?” Juan chuckled coldly and mocked. He was still being ostentatious at this time. Philip thought he would be afraid of him just because he knew Theo? His father was the president of the Jade Society. He knew people from high ranks as well! “You want to know my status?” Philip asked all of a sudden.</p>  <h2 id =chapter-153 > Chapter 153</h2>  <p id = > Philip squinted his eyes and there was a coldness in them. Juan trembled.</p>  <p id = > He felt that at this moment, Philip was radiating an aura that he could not understand. It was an air of over-confidence. “Philip, do you think you’re all that because you know Theo?” Juan scoffed. He forced himself to calm down. This must be fake. How could a coward like Philip become so strong all of a sudden? Juan had his father. His father knew people. He was not worried about what Philip might do to him! However, in the next second, Philip said calmly, “Juan, I’m not targeting you, but you’re always targeting me. I know you’re the one behind what happened tonight. If I let you go just like this, I won’t be able to forgive myself and I won’t be able to face Wynn.” As for Juan, Philip still had some sadness in his heart. The word</p>  <p id = > ‘friend’ had become foreign to him. Juan was stunned. He knitted his eyebrows together and chuckled coldly. “Philip, I don’t believe that you’ll do anything to me.” However, when he finished saying that, Philip said calmly on the sofa opposite him, “The reason you’re so arrogant is because of your father’s connections and power, and now, I’m going to destroy them</p>  <p id = > in front of you.” After he said that, Philip took out his phone and called George’s number. “Do it.” “Alright, Young Master. I already gave out the order,” George replied over the phone. It finally came to this. Philip would not regret this, because he would not allow anyone to hurt Wynn. The reason that Juan made this arrangement tonight was to use this opportunity to get Wynn. Therefore, he deserved what was coming for him. Juan laughed maniacally when he saw this. He pointed at Philip and said, “Philip, are you kidding me? Do you think my father will be destroyed because of one phone call? Stop dreaming! My father is the president of the Jade Society. Do you know how powerful he is? He was appointed by Mayor Sanders and the state!” Philip was indifferent toward Juan’s jeers and sarcasm. He just watched him calmly. Juan was too confident. After less than one minute of maniacal laughing, Juan’s phone rang. He looked at the caller ID and saw that it was from his father. Juan chuckled coldly. He was pleased and shook the phone. He said, “Look! Get a load of this! This is from my father. I want to ask him whether you’ve destroyed him or not!” He answered the call and asked loudly, “Dad, how’s it going?” “Juan! Did you offend someone? Who did you offend?” A roar came from the phone, loud enough to leave Juan’s brain buzzing. What was going on? Juan was shocked. He stopped laughing abruptly. Cold sweat started pouring from his temples. He had a bad feeling about this. “Dad, what do you mean?” Juan asked in confusion. His eyes landed on Philip hesitantly. “The city just announced that the Jade Society will be disbanded. I’ve been sacked as the president!” Robert Parker yelled furiously. “All seven of our jade shops are going to be investigated! Our assets have been frozen as well! Who the f*ck did you offend? Do you know how many times those jade merchants from Myanmar have called me?</p>  <p id = > You’ve caused me a great deal of trouble! The Parkers are now ruined because of you! You son of a b*tch! You unfilial child!” Crack! Currently, there was a storm in Juan’s heart. His father was sacked and their seven jade shops were being investigated! All seven shops! All of the assets and capital chain of the Parkers had been frozen! This meant that the Parkers were</p>  <p id = > broke! If that was the case, the Parkers were in debt of three billion bucks!</p>  <p id = > What was this? This was terrifying! “Dad! Dad… No way. How is this possible?” Juan refused to believe this. However, he was already covered in sweat and felt like he was walking on clouds. He collapsed on the sofa and his eyes were lifeless. “You still have the f*cking nerve to ask me? You son of a b*tch! They said that you’re the one who caused this! They named you!” Mr. Parker yelled at the phone. Suddenly, there was a sound of the door being broken open. “Robert Parker, you’ve been involved in the transfer of benefits and abuse of power. You’re now under arrest. Please come with us!” Juan heard it clearly. Then, there was a reluctant roar from Robert over the phone, “Son of a b*tch!” “Dad? Dad!” Juan was frantic. His face went white and the phone was hung up abruptly. He felt like his spine had been taken out of his body. He collapsed on the sofa limply. It was gone.</p>  <p id = > Everything was gone. Juan’s support collapsed in just one night. He was going to face up to a hundred jade merchants asking for their money back.</p>  <p id = > Plus, which one of those Burmese jade merchants were clean? They were more or less involved with the underground societies! Juan was terror-stricken. His life was over. His life could end at any time. This was too savage! Philip was too savage! He left no wiggle room. At this time, Philip got up calmly and said flatly, “Juan, you did this to yourself. This is a lesson from me to you. I hope you shape up in the future.” After he said that, he got up to leave. In a blink of an eye, everyone left. Juan sat lifelessly on the sofa all alone. He fell apart and started laughing uncontrollably. Then, he started wailing. He did not expect that he, Juan Parker, would lose to Philip Clarke. He did not even know how Philip had made it happen. It was just a phone call. One phone call! He was too scary! Philip was terrifying!</p>  <h2 id =chapter-154 > Chapter 154</h2>  <p id = > Back to Philip. After he got out of Juan’s mansion, he got into Theo’s car and drove to George’s place. “Old Man George, it’s so late. Why are you here?” Philip sat on the soft sofa and savored his wine. George walked in</p>  <p id = > front of Philip respectfully and bowed. He said, “Young Master, I’m sorry.</p>  <p id = > My mistakes have caused you to suffer unredressed injustice.” Philip replied indifferently, “Old Man George, don’t do this. It’s nothing. Tell me, what’s wrong? Why are you so anxious to see me?” George pondered for a while and answered deferentially, “Young Master, Miss Sommerset will be coming to Riverdale in a few days.” Clank! The room plunged into dead silence. Philip’s wine glass was suspended in the air. After a long while, he placed it on the marble coffee table that was adorned with gold lining. His face looked glum. His eyes looked lifeless. He looked as if he had something on his mind. After a long while, Philip asked while lifting his eyebrow slightly, “Why is she coming here?” Chloe Sommerset was a brilliant woman. She was also a proud woman with her own strong views. She was Philip’s childhood sweetheart. She was the youngest daughter of Hans Sommerset. The Sommerset family was a big shot in Capital City. Hans was the third generation of the Sommersets, making Chloe the third young lady of the family. She was the most beloved child in the family, which meant that she was spoiled and pampered to no ends. “Young Master, Miss Sommerset still holds a grudge on you for leaving the engagement party back then without a word. Perhaps she came to Riverdale to ask you for an explanation.” George squinted his eyes. He could see through this but he refused to reveal the actual facts. He was a sly old fox. The young master had been a playboy back then. He was responsible for a lot of lost love. It was as if Miss Sommerset was the one who helped him take care of all of his debt of love back then. How did she do it? With money. However, the young master left without saying a word and it hurt Chloe a lot. The reason she came to Riverdale this time might not be so simple. Philip was annoyed.</p>  <p id = > He was remorseful toward Chloe, extremely remorseful. “I got it. You have to keep this a secret, especially to Wynn, okay?” Philip frowned. There were all kinds of emotions in his heart. If Wynn knew that Philip had a fiancée, how would she feel? Would she ask for a divorce? Definitely. He had to hide this from Wynn. Even if he had to explain it to her, he needed to find a</p>  <p id = > good opportunity to do it. He did not have the mood to continue sitting here anymore. He got up and left. His face was glum. George drove Philip to the Old Johnston Manor himself. “Young Master, I should go now,” George said respectfully and was about to get into the Bentley. However, Philip said, “It’s late. You should come in.” George was stunned. He asked curiously, “Is this okay, Young Master?” “It’s fine. No one knows you. Plus, I should find an explanation for why I came out. As for the reason, please come up with one yourself,” Philip said. After he said that, he led George into the Old Johnston Manor. George sighed helplessly. He could never understand what his young master was thinking about. He asked his subordinates to drive the Bentley to another street before following Philip.</p>  <p id = > At this moment in the Old Johnston Manor, Wynn was crying uncontrollably. Her eyes were red. “Dad, you have to save Philip. He was framed!” Charles sat on the sofa, his face red from anger. His lips were twitching. “I won’t make this call! Philip was the one who caused this mess, so he should be the one taking care of it! If he was really framed, naturally, he would be let out.” Charles was livid. This was so embarrassing! How could his son-in-law do something like this! Martha was also furious. Her face was filled with shame and anger as she roared, “Good-for-nothing!</p>  <p id = > Scum of a community! He ruined our family name! Wynn, I told you, that spineless coward is not a good man. You refused to listen to me and insisted on being with him. Now, look at what has happened. You’ve seen everything. He’s just a useless bum with the heart of a beast! Go get a divorce with him tomorrow. You have to do it this time!” Martha was livid.</p>  <p id = > Her daughter had told them about this the second she got home. At that moment, Martha’s face fell. Her son-in-law was really going to embarrass them to no end! How would she live if this got into the ears of her neighbors?</p>  <p id = > She should grasp on this tightly so that she could force her daughter to get a divorce. Wynn covered her face and wailed. Her parents refused to help her. What should she do? At this moment, the doorbell rang. Martha was</p>  <p id = > furious, so naturally, she was hot-tempered. She shouted, “Who’s that? You cretin, why are you ringing my doorbell in the middle of the night?”</p>  <h2 id =chapter-155 > Chapter 155</h2>  <p id = > Swoosh! The door opened to reveal Philip standing there. Martha’s expression froze. Then, she said curiously, “Aren’t you in jail? How did you get out?” Philip smiled and said, “Mom, I didn’t break the law, so naturally they let me out.” At the same time, Wynn heard Philip’s voice and ran out.</p>  <p id = > She hugged Philip and wailed. Philip consoled her. “It’s alright now. I’m fine. See, I’m here now.” Everyone sat together in the living room. Martha and Charles sat on the sofa. Their eyes were piercing and they looked angry.</p>  <p id = > They stared at Philip like they were going to interrogate him. There was an old man next to Philip. It was George. Martha started at George, looking annoyed, “Philip, who is this old man? How can you bring strangers into my house?” Martha did not like this old man’s outfit. He was old and wearing a suit. He was also holding a black hat that she had never seen before. There was a grin on his face. It was obvious that he was not an honorable person. No wonder Philip was arrested by the police. He was hanging out with people like this! Philip explained calmly, “Mom, he’s my… friend. He’s the reason I got out.” Philip did not tell them what kind of friend he was. If he told her the man sitting opposite her was the richest man in Riverdale and that he was his butler, would Martha go insane? “My name is George Thomas. Nice to meet you two.” George knew that his young master’s mother-in-law was a devious person. She was famous for being unreasonable and causing a scene. Now that he got to see her in the flesh, she was indeed outstanding. “George… George Thomas?” Wynn finally came back to her senses. She looked at the person next to Philip and said in a surprised voice, “You’re really Mr. Thomas? George Thomas?”</p>  <p id = > “Wynn, you know this old man?” Martha pressed her lips together. She chuckled coldly. She looked like she was asking for someone to slap her across the face. “Mom, George is the richest man in Riverdale…” Wynn</p>  <p id = > said excitedly. Her husband knew George Thomas! “The richest man in Riverdale? A man like him?” Martha looked at George in disdain. She said in detest, “Wynn, stop joking. How can Philip know someone as rich as him? Besides, just because his name is George Thomas doesn’t mean he’s the same man as the one you’re talking about.” It was understandable that Martha did not know George. She did not care about the business world.</p>  <p id = > She only busied herself with minor gossips. Plus, in her eyes, how would a spineless coward like Philip know a rich man like that? If he really knew a rich man with a status like that, she would kowtow to him and thank him profusely. George’s face twitched at Martha’s jeers. However, he controlled his temper. Wynn was frantic. She kept on eying Martha but Martha ignored her. On the contrary, she started making nastier remarks at him. “Philip, next time, don’t bring any irrelevant people into our house. If not, don’t even think about stepping foot in this house again,” Martha said in dissatisfaction.</p>  <p id = > Even her eye bags were filled with frigid irony and scorching satire.</p>  <p id = > However, at the same time, the news started broadcasting on the television.</p>  <p id = > “According to our latest news, the richest man in our city and chairman of Apex Group, Mr. George Thomas, has funded 2 billion into building the largest police academy in our city. He has made huge contributions to the steady development of our city.” After the news was announced, the entire living room fell silent. Especially when George’s photo and interview footage was shown on the television. Martha’s eyes went wide. She stared at the richest man on the television and shifted her gaze to the old man who was sitting in front of her. Her eyes kept wandering back and forth between the two of them. “My word!” Martha started trembling from fear. She pointed to the television and said, “You… Y-you… You’re really that George Thomas? George Thomas, the richest man in Riverdale?” My gosh!</p>  <p id = > Martha was having an emotional breakdown. What had she done? What had she said? She was so silly! A rich man like him was in her house and she still made cutting remarks and mocked him!</p>  <h2 id =chapter-156 > Chapter 156</h2>  <p id = > “Oh, um… Mr. Thomas, please don’t misunderstand. Please don’t mind me.</p>  <p id = > I’m just a wretched old woman. I was just babbling before. Please don’t take my words to heart.” Martha was frantic, but she was excited. She got up and went over to brew some tea and cut some fruits. She wanted so badly to give George all the best food in her home. George just smiled lightly. He said courteously, “You don’t have to do that. I’m just driving little Philip home.</p>  <p id = > I’ll get going now.” “It’s nothing, it’s nothing at all. It’s such an honor to have you in our house, Mr. Thomas. Please have some, these are the fruits I just bought today. This is also the best Maojian tea. I won’t even be willing to drink this usually.” Martha’s attitude did a 180 change. She was eagerly attentive to George. She even interrupted Charles when he wanted to say something. “Sit there and read your newspaper,” Martha scolded Charles before turning around and looking at George like he was a national treasure.</p>  <p id = > Her eyes were shining brightly. Wynn felt helpless. Her mother was so embarrassing. Just now, she wanted to kick him out and now, she wanted to glue her eyes on him. “Mom, Mr. Thomas has to attend to numerous affairs of state every day. He’s busy,” Wynn said. Martha glared at Wynn and said,</p>  <p id = > “What do you know? Stop talking nonsense.” Then, she smiled and got up.</p>  <p id = > She glared at Philip and said, “Get up. Go over there.” For lack of a better option, Philip could only get up. Martha sat down directly next to George.</p>  <p id = > Her face was filled with flattery as she said, “Um, Mr. Thomas, how do you know our Philip?” Now, she was starting to talk about Philip. How shameless. Philip was just a spineless coward but to her surprise, he knew such a rich entrepreneur. The sun really came out from the west. George smiled and said, “I met Phil incidentally. He helped me last time and this time, I’m returning the favor by helping him.” “Oh, he helped you?” Martha murmured while smiling brightly. She peered at Philip and felt frustration in her heart. She thought that maybe Philip was something special. Who knew he was still a spineless coward. There were all kinds of favors in the</p>  <p id = > world and he used it to get himself out of prison! If she was the one asking for the favor, she would ask for a huge sum of money. Philip was helpless.</p>  <p id = > He did not say anything. At this moment, George got up and shook hands with everyone. He said, “I’m sorry, everyone. Since Phil is fine, then I shall head back now. Sorry for the disturbance.” How would Martha allow a money tree to walk away? She grabbed George’s hand and said frantically,</p>  <p id = > “Mr. Thomas, thank you for helping our Philip. Please come have dinner with us next time.” George smiled and exchanged a few words with Martha before leaving. Martha sent him off personally. When he got into the Bentley, she walked back to the house looking like she had not fully expressed herself. Bentley! That was a luxurious car! When she got into the house, she shouted excitedly, “Charlie, we’re gonna be rich! That was George Thomas! He’s rich! He’s a big millionaire!” Charles looked at her coldly and said, “You were ready to kick him out just now.” Charles was upset. There was such a rich and powerful man in his house earlier but he did not even get a chance to talk to him. This faded old woman dominated all of the conversations. Martha rolled her eyes at him and felt pleased with herself. It was unknown what she was thinking about right now. When she saw that Philip was still in the room, she changed her usual horrible temperament toward him and walked in front of him with a huge smile.</p>  <p id = > “Philip, don’t blame me for treating you like that in the past. If you had told me that you knew George Thomas sooner, I would’ve definitely treated you like you’re my own son.” Martha’s shamelessness was truly next level.</p>  <p id = > When Philip had no money nor power, she humiliated him and looked down on him to no end. Now that he knew George, she wanted to treat him like he was her own son. Wynn felt that Martha was crossing the line. Her own mother was so discriminatory. “Right, Philip. From now on, flatter George more. There will only be advantages and no disadvantages to this,” Martha said. “What did you help him with?” This was what Martha was concerned about the most. She was wondering whether she could get some money out of this. Philip made up a lie on the spot. “I was there when Mr. Thomas had</p>  <p id = > a heart attack on the street. I was the one who sent him to the hospital.” “Oh, that’s too bad. He didn’t give you any money?” When Martha said this, her eyes were glued on Philip. He had given her 100,000 bucks last time and it caused such a huge commotion. Was George the one who gave him that money? Then it must be more than 100,000! This guy must be hiding the rest of the money! She had to get it from him! “Mom, what are you thinking?</p>  <p id = > Do you not know what kind of person Philip is? How would he ask someone for money?” Wynn said, her face cold. What was her mother doing? Was she suspecting Philip? “What do you know? Shut up!” Martha yelled at Wynn before looking at Philip once more. She said, “Philip, you’re also addressing me as your mother. My daughter is married to you and she has suffered for three long years. You’ve embarrassed me and your father multiple times. You can’t hide this from us. How much did he give you?”</p>  <p id = > She was sure that Philip had received some money from George Thomas.</p>  <p id = > Philip looked at Wynn and sighed slightly. He did not have a choice. If he was targeted by Martha, he just had to comply. “One million. There’s still 900,000 bucks left. It’s to treat Mila’s illness.” Philip could only say that.</p>  <p id = > He told Wynn before that he had a card with one million bucks. One million bucks! When she heard this, Martha was full of energy. She stared at Philip and brought out the power of a mother-in-law. She reached out her hand and said coldly, “Give me the card. I’ll keep it for you.”</p>  <h2 id =chapter-157 > Chapter 157</h2>  <p id = > This was Martha’s true self. She would reach out her hand and ask for money like it was the most natural thing to do. She was a woman with no shame. Philip was dumbfounded. He did not know what to say, so he looked at Wynn instead. Wynn walked over and said coldly, “Mom, what are you doing? Even if Philip has that money, we can’t give it to you. It’s for Mila’s treatment.” Wynn knew Philip’s personality. He must be saying that he had one million bucks to deal with Martha. However, he did not expect his mother-in-law to ask for the money. When Martha heard that, her face fell.</p>  <p id = > She got up and started making a ruckus. “I never said I won’t use it to treat Mila. I’m just gonna keep this money for you and you can ask for it from me when you want to use it.” Wynn was furious. She would not give her the money no matter what. Martha did not even care about Mila. It would be hard to get the money back from her when she got her hands on the money.</p>  <p id = > Martha turned her head to look at Philip when Wynn refused. She asked bossily, “Philip, I’m going to ask you one more time. Are you giving this money to me for safekeeping or not?” It was clear that she was trying to debauch him. Philip had no choice. He took out the card that he had prepared way before this. After what happened at the bank, Philip prepared this card.</p>  <p id = > There was 900,000 bucks inside. Initially, he wanted to use this to deal with Wynn but who knew he was going to hand it to Martha tonight. Smack!</p>  <p id = > Martha was quick. Before Wynn could reach out her hand, she snatched it over. She rolled her eyes and said, “That’s more like it.” Then, she took the card happily and refused to let it out of her hand. She turned around and sashayed back into her bedroom. She finally got out after a long while.</p>  <p id = > When she got out, Philip and Wynn had already left. “Where are they?”</p>  <p id = > Martha asked curiously. Her face was cold. Charles sighed helplessly and said, “You’ve chased them away.” Martha pressed her lips together and murmured, “I only took one million from them. What? I can’t take this money? This is for their best. If this money is with Philip, he might waste all of it.” Martha looked down on Philip, so naturally she would not let him keep the money. “No, help me check where George Thomas’ office is. I’ll go over tomorrow. Philip saved his life and he only gave him one million.</p>  <p id = > He’s so rich, so he should be giving him ten million,” Martha said. She had already formulated a plan. She would not let this money tree walk away so easily. “Check for yourself. I don’t have time to indulge you in your tomfoolery.” Charles had a headache. He removed his presbyopic glasses and went back into his bedroom. “Charles Johnston, what do you mean? Am I being silly? I’m doing this for the family! If you care about your daughter, you should ask her to divorce Philip!” Martha was throwing yet another</p>  <p id = > tantrum. She started shouting and making a scene. Wynn woke up pretty early today because she had to represent her company to talk business with Turner's Second Hospital. The location of the meeting was at the meeting room of Beacon Pharmaceutical. Wynn planned to visit Mila in the hospital after the meeting. It had been two days since she saw Mila. It was worth mentioning that since last night, Wynn could not get into contact with Juan anymore. She did not really care about this because she assumed that Juan was busy. “Hello, Director Stanley. I’m glad that you’re here. I’m hoping that we can work together.” Inside the meeting room, Wynn represented her company to talk to the new person in charge of Turner’s Second Hospital.</p>  <p id = > This time, there were six representatives from Beacon Pharmaceutical.</p>  <p id = > Naturally, Derrick was there. After all, he could not just leave this important collaboration to his employees. “Hello, Mr. Hall, Miss Johnston. I didn’t expect that Miss Johnston is so young and talented.” Director Stanley was polite and modest. Both sides had greeted each other. Then, they started to negotiate on the terms of the collaboration. “Miss Johnston, as per our director’s request, we have already prepared the contract. Please have a look. If everything’s in order, we can sign it directly,” said Director Stanley.</p>  <p id = > “Ah!” Wynn and Derrick were shocked. They did not expect the other party to be so clear cut. Was Philip so respectable? “Director Stanley, you… Are you sure you’re not joking?” Derrick asked in disbelief. This was the fastest collaboration in history. Plus, it was with Turner’s Second Hospital! Derrick did not understand. Was this all because of Wynn? “Mr. Derrick, don’t worry. This was arranged by Director Turner. As long as Miss Johnston is here, we can sign this and start working together,” Director Stanley smiled and said. When he said that, the secretary handed the contract to Wynn and Derrick. The two of them scanned the contract and found that the contract was tailor-made for Beacon Pharmaceutical. The profit for them was unimaginable! If they signed this contract, Beacon Pharmaceutical would make at least 200 million more!</p>  <h2 id =chapter-158 > Chapter 158</h2>  <p id = > 200 million? Derrick almost fell down from his chair. “Director Stanley, are you sure you’re not joking? It’s obvious that the terms in this contract are more beneficial to Beacon.” Wynn felt like she was dreaming. This was unbelievable. Director Stanley smiled and said, “Miss Johnston, we’ve already signed it. What else are you worried about?” Wynn looked over and the contract was indeed signed. It was also stamped. This meant that as long as Wynn signed it, the contract would be in effect. It seemed like Philip and Professor Turner’s relationship was not that simple. There must be something she did not know. She had to go back and ask Philip. Recently, Wynn realized she understood Philip less and less. He had changed too much. When she thought about that, Wynn lifted the pen and was about to sign. However, at this moment! The door of the meeting room was opened.</p>  <p id = > In a flash, eight bodyguards in suits barged in and stood at the door. An elegant woman with a strapless long white Valentino dress walked in. Her features were perfect, and her tall nose was very defined. There were arrogance and coldness in her eyes. She was wearing a wide pink sun hat and a pair of expensive LV crystal shoes. She also had on a pair of white silk gloves, and on her neck, there was a diamond necklace. They were all pink diamonds. This woman was radiating an air of elegance. At the same time, she was so cold that she looked totally unapproachable. The moment she walked into the meeting room, everyone’s eyes were on her. She was gorgeous! She looked even more beautiful than celebrities! Plus, her body was amazing. She was holding a red LV bag with her fair hand. Her long and slender legs looked like they had been drawn by an artist. Her skin was also glowing. Like porcelain, it looked like it would break upon contact. A sense of class was oozing from every pore on her skin. Only rich young ladies would have this kind of classiness. Every woman in the meeting room felt ashamed and lacking after looking at her. Only Wynn could compare with this woman’s beauty. However, she still lost when it came to class.</p>  <p id = > This was the meeting of a princess from a royal family and a princess from an ordinary family. Everyone was shocked. No one knew who this woman was. “I’m sorry, I don’t think you should sign this contract.” This was what the woman said after she barged in. Her tone was icy. It was as if one had entered an ice world. Plus, she was exerting an invisible pressure on everyone. “Miss, I am the chairman of Beacon Pharmaceutical, Derrick Hall. And you are?” Derrick stood up. He smiled and was being a gentleman. The woman just glanced at him coldly and said, “You don’t have the qualifications to know who I am.” How arrogant! How rampant! How proud! This woman was covered in icicles all over her body. Then, under everyone’s gaze, the woman walked in front of Wynn. She lifted her eyebrows and enunciated, “Are you Wynn Johnston?” Wynn was shocked by the overwhelming pressure that this woman was exerting on her. She nodded her head. “Yes, and you are…” It was obvious that this woman was not easy to deal with. She was adorned with branded goods all over. She was definitely a young lady from an affluent family. However, how did she know her? Slap! A loud slap landed on Wynn’s face. The sound resonated in the entire meeting room. Wynn was stunned. She was in disbelief.</p>  <p id = > Everyone else present was in disbelief too. “Miss, why did you hit her?”</p>  <p id = > Derrick was shocked. He wanted to uphold justice for Wynn. However, this woman in front of him only peered at him coldly. It was enough to make Derrick tremble in fear. She was so scary! That woman’s eyes were too icy!</p>  <p id = > “Go back and tell Philip Clarke that you took this slap for him. He should know what to do.” After she said that, the woman turned around and left with a trail of coldness behind her. When she got to the door of the meeting room, she turned around again. Then, she grinned at Wynn and said, “I forgot to tell you. My name is Chloe Sommerset.”</p>  <h2 id =chapter-159 > Chapter 159</h2>  <p id = > After that icy woman left the meeting room, everyone still could not calm down. Wynn’s face was burning. She did not even know who that was.</p>  <p id = > However, it seemed like she knew Philip. Derrick looked apologetic. He said, “Director Stanley, I’m sorry about that. Um, about our collaboration...”</p>  <p id = > Director Stanley smiled and tried to soothe the awkwardness. “Of course there’s nothing wrong with the collaboration. We can just…” Before he could finish, Director Stanley’s phone rang. After he answered the call, Director Stanley said a few things before his face fell. “Alright, I got it.”</p>  <p id = > “What’s wrong, Director Stanley? What’s going on?” Derrick could read the changes in Director Stanley’s face. Did something happen? “I’m sorry, Mr. Hall, Miss Johnston. We have to stop this collaboration. I don’t really know the details. I have to go back and discuss this further with Director Turner. I’m sorry.” Director Stanley said that and left with his people. There were now only Derrick and his people in the meeting room. Everyone stood with confusion on their faces. Naturally, everyone was looking at Wynn deviously. “Miss Johnston, what’s going on? Do you know that woman?”</p>  <p id = > Derrick was suppressing his anger. He knew this might have something to do with that woman. Especially when that woman mentioned that spineless coward, Philip Clarke! Damn it! Did Philip get into trouble and cause this collaboration between Beacon and Turner to fail? Wynn’s face turned cold.</p>  <p id = > She grabbed her bag and controlled her emotions. She bid farewell to Derrick. “I’m sorry, Mr. Hall. I have to go.” After she said that, Wynn left the meeting room instantly. The meeting room started being noisy after she left. “Mr. Hall, I think there’s an 80% chance that Miss Johnston’s involved in this.” “This was such a great chance. It was a great opportunity for Beacon to hit the market but it’s all ruined now by Miss Johnston!” “Who was that woman? She’s so cold and fierce. I’m still scared!” A few people were discussing it noisily. There was dissatisfaction toward Wynn in their conversations. Derrick slammed his hand on the table and said, “That’s enough. Shut up now, all of you!” Derrick’s head was in pain. Wynn was the one who made this happen and she was also the one who destroyed this.</p>  <p id = > There were some suspicion and disapproval toward her in his heart now.</p>  <p id = > Back to Philip. He did not need to go to the office. He left everything to</p>  <p id = > Agnes as he believed in Agnes’ abilities. For the first time, Wynn’s cousin, Lynn, asked Philip out. The two of them decided to meet at Game Central.</p>  <p id = > Lynn even brought a few of her friends. “Philip, why are you only here now?” When Lynn saw Philip walking over slowly, she ran over to him sweetly and grabbed his arm. She looked obedient and lovable. Philip could not accept this sudden change. He asked suspiciously, “Why did you ask me here?” Lynn smiled with her lips pressed together. She said, “To have fun!</p>  <p id = > Come, let me take you to meet my friends.” Did Lynn only ask him here to have fun? Was it really so simple? Of course not. When her friends saw Philip, they immediately gave him looks of disgust and sarcasm. “Lynn, this is your cowardly brother-in-law? He’s really something else. Is looking homeless a trend now?” “Lynn, are you joking? He looks like this but you’re saying he can treat us to a whole day here?” “Never mind, let’s go home.</p>  <p id = > How disappointing. Even I feel embarrassed standing next to someone like that.” They started talking one after another. They were all jabbing and criticizing Philip. Damn, this man looked so wretched. He was wearing a pair of dirty sport shoes with no brand. His blue sweatshirt was also turning white from frequent washing. He stood out among the gang. When Lynn saw that her friends were looking down on Philip, she fought back and said,</p>  <p id = > “What do you know? My brother-in-law is amazing! Do you know Theo Zander? Even Theo needs to be deferential to my brother-in-law.” The reason she brought her friends here was to show off. Lynn was unhappy when she heard them making fun of Philip like that. Theo Zander? Her friends looked at each other before laughing while holding their stomachs.</p>  <p id = > “Lynn, is your brain not functioning?” “Do you know who Theo Zander is?</p>  <p id = > How would a p*ssy like him know Theo Zander?” “If he knows Theo Zander, I’ll kneel and call him my grandpa!” The boys who were dressed stylishly and behaving improperly had mockery and sarcasm on their faces.</p>  <p id = > People like them who dabbled with gangs would know who Theo was. He was the underground king of Riverdale! He had more than 100 gathering</p>  <p id = > places and also more than 100 men! Now Lynn was saying that Philip was one rank above Theo? Impossible. What a colossal joke!</p>    <h2 id =chapter-160 > Chapter 160</h2>  <p id = > Lynn was panicking. She stomped her feet and grabbed Philip’s arm. She said, “Philip, tell them if this is real or not. No, you have to call Theo now and tell him to come here!” Lynn was starting to throw a tantrum. She had never been suspected like this before, so of course she was feeling unhappy.</p>  <p id = > However, Philip shook his head and said, “I’m sorry, I don’t know any Theo Zander. Lynn, did you make a mistake?” “Hahaha!” Laughter immediately erupted. Lynn’s face went red. She could feel the detest coming from her friends. She felt like a featherless chicken that was standing in front of everyone naked. She was being criticized and shamed by everyone. “Lynn, that’s enough. Your brother-in-law has already said that, so stop lying to us already. We won’t laugh at you.” “Your brother-in-law is an honest man.</p>  <p id = > He’s not that much of an idiot it seems.” “That’s enough. We’ll just go and have fun ourselves.” Her friends left while laughing. Lynn was livid. She turned around angrily and swung her hand to slap Philip. She yelled, “Philip, why aren’t you telling the truth? Are you happy now that I’m being mocked by them?” However, her hand was caught in the air by Philip. “Lynn, I’m warning you. Don’t try to use me. If it isn’t for the fact that you’re Wynn’s cousin, you wouldn’t even be able to stand here and talk to me like this, do you understand?” Philip turned cold all of a sudden. His tone was icy, and there was anger flickering in his eyes. Lynn was stunned. She retracted her hand. Then, she stared at Philip fearfully and angrily. After a long while,</p>  <p id = > she said, “Philip Clarke, you’ll regret this.” ‘How dare he yell at me! ‘Damn it!’ Lynn was unhappy. She was humiliated by her friends and now she was getting yelled at by Philip. She had never been so battered. However, Philip replied flatly, “Whatever, but I’m warning you, if you dare to do something out of line, you’ll have to suffer the consequences.” After he said that, Philip turned around and walked away with his hands in his pockets. Looking at Philip’s back, Wynn was going mad with anger. She stomped her feet on the ground and said angrily, “Philip, how dare you offend me! I will make you regret this! I’m so mad!” She wanted to get back at Philip. The easiest way was to threaten him with something. After Philip left, he went to Apex Group to see George. “Young Master, I’ve prepared the birthday present you asked for. Do you want me to open it for you to take a look?” George looked respectful. Behind him was a blonde secretary with blue eyes. She was holding an embroidered box that was the size of a fist. The box looked delicate. It was obvious that the contents inside were valuable just by looking at the box. Philip took it from the secretary and said, “No need. It’s just a gift. Your box is too fancy. Change it to another one that looks simpler.” In a flash, the secretary changed it to a normal box. Philip held it in his hands and nodded while feeling at ease. “Alright, I’ll go back now.”</p>  <p id = > When Philip walked to the door, he stopped suddenly. He asked slowly,</p>  <p id = > “When will Chloe arrive in Riverdale?” “Miss Sommerset might be arriving in these two days,” George replied, looking worried. The young master’s past romance. She was not an easy person to deal with. She was the Sommersets’ third daughter, after all. Plus, she had been so badly hurt back then. Chloe had been looking for Philip these past years. She only found him because he inherited his family’s fortune during this period of time.</p>  <p id = > Back then, Philip had left without saying anything. This morning, Martha went out early in the morning. She was wearing a typical checkered middle-aged woman attire and holding a tumbler of black chicken soup that she made herself. She called a car and went to Apex Group. She was giddy with glee and felt like she was walking on clouds. Why did Martha come here?</p>  <p id = > She came here to see George, of course. She had planned this out clearly.</p>  <p id = > She was going to fawn over George and would ask him for money! Philip saved his life, so one million was too little. Philip felt embarrassed to ask for more but she was not. She was thick-skinned. She would not ask for much, she would only ask for ten million. If he refused, then she would ask for five million. If he still refused, she would make a fuss. He had such a big company and was the richest man in Riverdale. He must be loaded. He would not care about these few million bucks. When she got to Apex Group, Martha got out of the car and went to the entrance of the building. At the same time, a group of people walked out. It was George! Martha’s eyes brightened. She wanted to rush over while being full of joy and expectations.</p>  <p id = > However, Martha stopped walking. Was that not Philip next to George?</p>  <p id = > Why was that coward here? Martha hid at one side hurriedly. Then, she saw George asking Philip to get into the Bentley respectfully. Respectfully! She saw this with her own two eyes. George was being so respectful to Philip.</p>  <p id = > He even bowed and opened the door for him. How… How was this possible? Was this really her spineless son-in-law, Philip Clarke?</p>  <h2 id =chapter-161 > Chapter 161</h2>  <p id = > She was panicking! Martha was beyond frantic now. She hurriedly took out her phone with trembling hands and took a photo. She wanted to save some evidence so that she could go back and ask Philip. Naturally, Martha was suspicious of Philip’s identity now. How could a spineless coward get into the same luxury car as the richest man in Riverdale? Martha could not understand this. She turned around and left. When she got back home, she told Charles everything. “Charlie, look at this. Is this Philip?” Charles was fiddling with his birds. He put down the birdcage and put on his presbyopic glasses to take a look. He said, “Why did you take his picture? Are you still following Philip?” Charles was shocked. What was wrong with his wife?</p>  <p id = > She was even using such cheap tricks to stalk him? Martha glared at him and smacked him on the arm. She said, “Look at the person next to him!”</p>  <p id = > Charles was curious. He looked closely and exclaimed, “Is… Is that George Thomas?” Martha nodded and sat on the sofa. She crossed her arms and started pondering with a look of disbelief on her face. Then, she said, “Philip must be hiding something from us. Charlie, call him now and ask him to come over. I need to ask him what’s his relationship with George. I want to know if he’s hiding more money from me.” Martha was only concerned about the money. She believed Philip must have taken a lot of money for himself. He must have taken more than one million bucks. After all, he had saved someone’s life. Plus, the other guy was treating him so courteously.</p>  <p id = > Charles hesitated for a while and said suddenly, “Martha, don’t you think that Philip has been acting differently from before?” How would Martha care about this? She slammed her hand on the table and said, “What’s so different? He’s still a spineless coward. If he’s really different, I, as his mother-in-law, will hire a palanquin with eight carriers to bring him to our home honorably!” Charles sighed helplessly and said, “Why are you doing this? Philip is our son-in-law, after all. Do you have to treat him this way?”</p>  <p id = > Even though Charles did not want to recognize a good-for-nothing like Philip as his son-in-law, at the end of the day, the fact could not be changed.</p>  <p id = > Martha glared at him and said, “Why are you talking so much? Call him now!” When she saw that Charles did not make a move, she took out her own phone and said angrily, “If you won’t do it, I will!” After she dialed the number, Martha waited. When the call went through, Martha said arrogantly, “Philip, where are you? Come to my house now. Your father-in-law and I have something to ask you.” When Philip got Martha’s call, he had just arrived at the hospital with George. Her tone was unfriendly and it sounded like she was interrogating him. He smiled and said, “Mom, I’m at the hospital. I’ll go there in a bit.” “No! Get over here now!” Martha said proudly. Slam! She hung up the phone without waiting for a reply, making Philip sigh helplessly. He called a car and went to the Old Johnston Manor.</p>  <p id = > When he got inside the house, Philip could feel the coldness inside. Martha was sitting on the sofa. She looked at him with the corner of her eyes. She</p>  <p id = > said coldly, “You’re here. Sit.” Philip nodded and greeted the two elders.</p>  <p id = > Then, he sat on the single-seated sofa diagonally across Martha. He asked,</p>  <p id = > “Mom, what’s wrong? Why did you ask me to come here in such a hurry?”</p>  <p id = > Martha did not beat around the bush. She said frankly, “Philip, what’s your relationship with George? Did you really just save him? That’s all?” Philip was shocked. What did Martha find out? No way! He had been hiding this quite well. “Mom, didn’t I already explain it to you? Why don't I ask Mr.</p>  <p id = > Thomas over to explain this again?” Philip said. However, Martha chuckled coldly and grabbed her phone. Then, she put it in front of Philip and pointed at the screen. “Is this you?” He was still lying to him! When Philip saw the photo, his heart dropped. Was Martha stalking him? He lifted his eyebrows, and his face fell. Philip looked disgusted as he said, “It’s me. However, this doesn’t mean anything. I was just there to express my gratitude. In the end, Mr. Thomas was very courteous to me. He walked me out personally and drove me back to my office.” “That’s all?” Martha was curious. However, she had no proof that Philip was lying. Philip chuckled and said, “Then will you two believe me if I tell you I own Apex Group and George is working for me?” Of course not! Martha would not believe this. She would know what kind of person her son-in-law was. If it was just like he said, why did he choose to suffer her cold shoulders and humiliation all this time?</p>  <h2 id =chapter-162 > Chapter 162</h2>  <p id = > Philip knew they would not believe him, so he purposely said that.</p>  <p id = > Sometimes, people would not want to believe the truth. Martha did not say anything. It was unclear what she was thinking about. Then, she said in a commanding tone, “You don’t need to go to Wynn’s grandfather’s birthday that’s happening in two days. Just stay home.” Martha’s father would be celebrating his 70th birthday the day after tomorrow. She did not want to bring this cowardly man over. If not, she would be shamed endlessly by her family members from her maternal home. Plus, the old master had always been unhappy about Wynn’s marriage. Would she be congratulating her</p>  <p id = > father or infuriating him by bringing Philip back? Philip expected this, so he did not say anything. He took out a box from his pocket and said, “Mom, this is the gift I prepared for the old master.” Martha looked at the embroidered box on the table and murmured, “What’s this? The box looks so bad. Are you giving him something that’s only worth a few dozen bucks?” Martha did not even want to open the box to take a look. She did not want to dirty her eyes. What good thing could Philip afford to give the old master? Would it not be a joke for her to bring this box to the old master?</p>  <p id = > When Philip was about to say something, Charles mediated the dispute and said, “Martha, it’s something from Philip’s heart. Can you stop causing trouble now?” Martha scoffed and said coldly, “Alright. You should go now.” Before Philip could walk out of the door, Martha’s second sister, Paula, walked in while dressed stylishly. She was not courteous at all. She immediately sat down on the sofa and yelled, “Martha, get me a glass of water! It’s so hot and I’m parched.” Martha’s face fell, but she still fetched a glass of water for her second sister. Paula took a few sips before noticing Philip. She sneered with a surprised expression. “Oh, Philip is here too!</p>  <p id = > That’s good. I’m here to talk to you about this. The old master’s birthday is in two days. You guys should go with our Samantha’s car.” Go there with their car? Martha was curious, so she asked, “Paula, will we fit in Sammy’s car? “Of course!” Paula was excited. She said with a grin, “Our Frankie just bought a new car for Sammy. It’s a Lincoln Navigator they said. It’s over a million bucks and it’s a seven-seater. So it’ll definitely fit all of you.” She was clearly showing off. This was why Paula was here. Martha’s face fell as she glared at Philip furiously. She was calling him a good-for-nothing bum in her heart. Paula was ecstatic. She was indeed here to show off. Now that she saw their unwilling and helpless faces, she felt extremely pleased with herself. Paula felt resentful toward Philip for failing to meet expectations and said, “Martha, it’s alright. Just tell Philip to work harder.</p>  <p id = > Perhaps he’ll be able to buy a good car in a few years. Right, Philip?” When Philip’s name was mentioned, he chuckled and said, “You’re being</p>  <p id = > hilarious, Aunt Paula. How can I compete with Frank? He owns a company.” “Sigh, you can’t say that. Even though there’s a huge difference between you and Frankie, I know that you can endure a lot of hardship. Why don’t I ask Frankie to help keep a lookout on any vacancy that’s suitable for you in his company? I’ll ask him to help out because after all, we’re family.</p>  <p id = > We have to keep the goodies within the family. You’ll even throw a bone to your dog.” Paula chuckled. Her expression betrayed how she was feeling right now. Her words were laced with jeers and mockery. Of course her nephew-in-law was nothing compared to her Frankie. She was just saying without meaning any of it. She wanted to flex her son-in-law's ability.</p>  <p id = > Philip’s face fell. Did she just call him a dog? Hehe. “Thank you, Aunt Paula,” Philip took in a deep breath and said calmly. “Alright, I’ll be going now. I’ll ask Sammy to pick you up in two days.” Paula came quickly and left quickly once she was done showing off. After Paula left, Martha was livid. She smashed the cup and screamed at Philip angrily, “Who asked you to chime in? You worthless piece of trash! Look at your Aunt Paula’s sonin-law and look at you! What has Frankie bought for his wife? An LV bag, gold necklaces, and gold rings. Now, he even bought a luxury car that’s worth over a million bucks! Before this, he even bought a three-story mansion that costs over ten million! What about you? What have you ever bought for us? How did I get such a spineless bum like you as my son-in-law? I’m so mad! You’re not allowed to come to the birthday party, do you hear me?” Martha was so angry that her head was throbbing. She sat on the sofa while fuming. “Why are you still standing there? Get lost! I get a headache whenever I see you!” Philip was feeling helpless. He had bought a house too. It was at the other courtyard in Dragon City. It was the most expensive one. It was called First Palace and it was worth a billion bucks!</p>  <p id = > Luxury car? He had all of the luxury cars in the world. His parking lot was built on a hill. “Mom, I bought a house not long ago too,” Philip looked at the angry Martha and said suddenly after pondering.</p>  <h2 id =chapter-163 > Chapter 163</h2>  <p id = > After he said that, Martha stared at Philip. Her gaze was sharp, looking as if she was trying to find something on Philip’s face. “What? Did you say you bought a house? Philip, do you know what you’re talking about? You’ve been poor for three years but now you can afford a house? I don’t think you can even afford a toilet!” Martha was furious. Philip was really something else. He was still trying to lie to her at this moment. He could afford a house?</p>  <p id = > Martha even paid half of the amount of the house he and Wynn were living in right now. The average property price in Riverdale was 20,000 to 30,000</p>  <p id = > bucks per square feet. How could he afford that? “Mom, before I got married to Wynn, I brought over some savings from my home. I bought it recently so if you and dad want to live there, I can arrange for it right now,” Philip said calmly. This time, Charles could not continue watching this anymore.</p>  <p id = > He had been fiddling with his antiques at one side before this. He scoffed and said, “Philip, your mother berates you because you refuse to grow up.</p>  <p id = > Now, you’re boasting in front of us. Aren’t you ashamed? You said you bought a house. With what? How much savings do you have?” Charles could be quite savage when he started scolding someone. Martha chimed in sarcastically, “When you got married to Wynn, your parents were not there.</p>  <p id = > It’s obvious that they look down on us. What’s wrong? Are you from a rich family or are you an aristocrat? I can count the amount of your savings with my eyes closed.” Philip pressed his lips together. He wanted to tell Martha that if she really wanted to count his money, she would never be able to finish counting them for hundreds of generations. Martha got up to push Philip out of the door when she saw that he was not talking. She said, “That’s enough. Go home now. Don’t forget that you’re not allowed to come the day after tomorrow. Go to the hospital to take care of your daughter.” After she kicked Philip out, Martha sat on the sofa. Anger was boiling in her stomach. “Charlie, what do you think Paula meant? Did she come all the way here to show off? It’s just a stupid car! It wasn’t paid for with her own</p>  <p id = > money either. She’s just depending on her son-in-law, so why’s she so pleased with herself? She’s just a chicken who wants to become a phoenix!”</p>  <p id = > Martha was scolding furiously. She was livid. When her gaze landed on the box on the coffee table, she got even angrier. What present could that good-for-nothing give anyway? She opened the box to take a look at what he wanted to give the old master. When Martha opened the box and saw what was inside, she was furious. “What is this? It’s just a stupid ornamental thumb ring! He was going to give this worthless trash to the old master for his birthday! He must have bid this from an antique market. I’m so mad! He has completely embarrassed me!” Martha looked at it a few more times and put the jade ornamental thumb ring back in the box. Then, she started to sulk. Charles only took a glance at the ring and did not pay much attention to it. He did not want to care about it anyway, so he said, “Why are you making life difficult for yourself? Aren’t you just looking for trouble?”</p>  <p id = > Martha stared at him and got up to leave. At the same time in Cloud Pavilion, the biggest antique place in Capital City. A tall and slender woman in a suit pushed open the heavy door and walked into the vast office. There were various valuable antiques and precious stones all over the room. “Boss, are you looking for me?” The woman bowed. Her hands were on her stomach.</p>  <p id = > She was respectful. A middle-aged man who looked like he was in his 40s sat on the chair. He was wearing a pair of black-rimmed glasses and there was a thin golden chain on his glasses. He had a large build, and his face was solemn. He looked unflustered. Don Garcia was the boss of Cloud Pavilion. He was also a famous collector in the country. He had a net worth of ten billion! “Do you have the information of the person I asked you to investigate?” Don’s voice was robust. He sounded like an old clock. He gave out an air of authority. The woman replied respectfully, “I checked, but I couldn’t find anything. We already gave out an invitation of goodwill, but they rejected us.” Don nodded and said, “Keep investigating. We have to find them. Tell me once you find anything.” “Alright, Boss.” The woman</p>  <p id = > went out of the office. Don got up and stood in front of the french window.</p>  <p id = > He looked out at the night view of Capital City.</p>  <h2 id =chapter-164 > Chapter 164</h2>  <p id = > Two days ago, Cloud Pavilion sold an item at a sky-high price—130</p>  <p id = > million! It was a jade ornamental thumb ring that once belonged to Emperor Qianlong! When news got out, the entire city was shaken to its core! It had been quite a while since someone dared to bid like this. 130 million! The buyer was so rich and imposing! Don contacted his people to get in touch with the buyer immediately. However, they could not find them and were rejected directly when an invitation was sent out. This buyer was so mysterious. They must be someone rich and powerful. Don had to find them immediately. At the same time, the Yates were indulging in a cheerful and joyous atmosphere. Old Master Yates was celebrating his 70th birthday. It was a huge occasion! Old Master Yates’ name was Bob Yates. He was a high-ranking secretary of an organization and held an important position.</p>  <p id = > He had many students, and it could be said that he was highly respected.</p>  <p id = > After he retired, he went back to Yates Village and became the most respected person there. It was all because of his position in the family hierarchy. The Yates became the most influential family in the village.</p>  <p id = > There were a lot of different branches in the family tree. There were more than ten families with that name. With Bob’s prestige, he led a nice life.</p>  <p id = > Some of his children joined the organization and some ventured into the business world. Of course, some were just idle in general. After all, one would get all kinds of people when one had a large family. Back then, Bob had assisted Charles financially, so that was how he got a good opportunity.</p>  <p id = > The Yates Courtyard had the typical tall white walls of Hui-style architecture. It had three halls with two enclosed courtyards. There was a pond, a fake mountain, and a landscape garden in the main courtyard. They displayed the imposing manner of the top family in Yates Village. Old Master Yates’ children and grandchildren were excited about his birthday</p>  <p id = > party. Not only did they want to congratulate the old master, but they also wanted to see a certain someone. “Do you think that good-for-nothing will come to the old master’s party?” Inside the Yates Courtyard, a gang of youngsters was chatting while having tea. “Of course not! Aunt Martha won’t let him come. She didn’t bring him last time.” “Yeah, the old master doesn’t like Philip, so it’ll only anger the old master if Aunt Martha brings him.” “I don’t know what Wynn was thinking. She insisted on marrying that spineless bum. I’m going to die from laughter.” They were all from the Yates family. They were born in Yates Village. “He can’t just not show up.</p>  <p id = > I want to see him make a fool out of himself. Let me call Aunt Martha and tell her to bring him along,” a young man said. He looked quite handsome.</p>  <p id = > There was a necklace with a gold lock on his neck. His name was Eric Yates.</p>  <p id = > He was the only son of Samson Yates, the fourth child of the old master. He was also the youngest one in the third generation of Yates. The old master was very fond of him. As such, he was spoilt until he was arrogant and condescending. “Aunt Martha, this is Eric. I want to ask you something.</p>  <p id = > Will your son-in-law Philip come to my grandpa’s birthday party?” Eric shushed his cousins by putting his finger on his lips. “Eric! What’s wrong?</p>  <p id = > Do you miss your useless brother-in-law?” Martha mocked over the phone.</p>  <p id = > Eric chuckled and said, “I was just asking. It has been a while since I saw him.” Martha replied, “Alright, I know what you’re thinking about. Philip will definitely show up this time. If he refuses, I’ll tie him up and drag him there, okay?” When he got the answer he wanted, Eric exchanged a few more words with Martha before hanging up. Then, he announced to everyone, “Alright, Philip will be here. Let’s get ready. We’ll watch how he makes a fool out of himself later.” The group of people looked at each other and smirked. Their faces looked pleased as they thought about their evil plans. This was such a grand party. How boring would it be if they did not cause some drama? Plus, Philip was always the butt of the joke. He could not be absent. After some planning from Eric and his gang, this plan was brewing quickly. Almost all of the Yates knew that Philip would be coming</p>  <p id = > to the old master’s party. Not only the youngsters but even the seniors including Samson were shaking their heads in disdain. Samson said angrily,</p>  <p id = > “If a coward like Philip comes to congratulate the old master, it’ll bring shame to the Yates.” Philip had no idea about this. He went to the hospital to visit Mila and ran into Wynn in the hospital room. “Wynn, you got off early today,” Philip said with a grin. Wynn peered at him coldly and did not reply. Philip did not know what to do now. “Are you in a bad mood?” Philip sat down next to Wynn and asked softly. Wynn was furious. She was keeping her anger inside of her. She wanted to ask him but did not want to be the one who made the first move. She wanted Philip to explain to her himself. Mila ran over quietly and approached Philip’s ear. She said softly in a sweet voice, “Daddy, Mommy is not happy. She told Mila that daddy’s having an affair. There’s a pretty aunty out there.” An affair? Philip was amused. He said immediately, “Wynn, what are you thinking? Do you think a man like me will have an affair?” Wynn could not take it anymore. She turned her head, showing her red eyes. Tears were rolling in her eyes. One would feel a twinge of pain in their hearts from looking at her eyes. “Philip, who is Chloe Sommerset?” Wynn asked suddenly. She was trying hard to control her emotions.</p>  <h2 id =chapter-165 > Chapter 165</h2>  <p id = > Chloe Sommerset. How did Wynn know about Chloe? Philip was stunned.</p>  <p id = > His words were stuck in his throat. He did not know how to answer her.</p>  <p id = > Wynn’s eyes were red with some moisture in them. She looked at Philip and tried to catch something from the changes in his expression. In the end, she only felt disappointment. She was disappointed in Philip. Wynn covered her mouth and got up. Then, she left the room while sobbing. Philip did not say anything because he did not know how to explain this situation to her. He was not ready to explain this to Wynn. Wynn cried for a while in the toilet.</p>  <p id = > She was sure that Philip was having an affair as he did not explain the matter to her. Wynn’s heart was hurting. She did not know how to face Philip. More</p>  <p id = > than ten minutes had passed before Wynn finally calmed down. She went back to the room and did not see Philip. She then continued to accompany Mila with a glum face. Philip had tried to explain himself a few times but it was as if the words were stuck in his throat. He could not get them out. The atmosphere in the room was depressing, so Philip exited the room while Wynn was still in the toilet. When he got out, he called Mindy. “Mindy, did anything happen at your company today?” On the other end of the phone, Mindy was obviously mad. She scoffed a few times and said, “Hmph! Philip Clarke, you absolute trash of a man, do not call me again!” Slam! She hung up. Philip did not understand what was going on. He muttered to himself and called the number again. In the end, Mindy yelled at him and hurled abuses at him, “Philip Clarke! Stop calling me! You f*ckboy, I’m blocking you!” “Wait, Mindy, I have something to ask you. It’s serious,” Philip said quickly. He was scared that Mindy would block him. When the other party did not say anything, he asked hurriedly, “Did Wynn run into anyone in the office today?” He could guess what had happened. Wynn had gone to discuss business with Turner, but she asked about Chloe when she got back.</p>  <p id = > It could only mean that she ran into her in the office. Mindy said coldly,</p>  <p id = > “You’re asking me? Don’t you know what shameful deed you’ve done?</p>  <p id = > Wynn loves you so much and you… You cheated on her behind her back!</p>  <p id = > You f*ckboy!” Mindy was livid. She was fighting for justice on behalf of Wynn. How dare a good-for-nothing like Philip have an affair! The entire company knew what had happened in the meeting room. “Mindy, you’ve misunderstood me. Am I that kind of person? Tell me who Wynn ran into at the office today,” Philip said. Mindy hesitated for a while and said angrily,</p>  <p id = > “The collaboration with Turner went to sh*t. A woman named Chloe Sommerset barged in halfway and slapped Wynn during the meeting…”</p>  <p id = > Chloe slapped Wynn? Instantly, Philip’s face turned cold. His eyes also became piercing. Wynn did not tell him this. Philip felt remorseful toward Chloe, but he would not allow anyone to bully Wynn. “Alright, I got it.”</p>  <p id = > Philip hung up the phone. His temperament became intimidating. He called</p>  <p id = > George immediately. “Old Man George, get in touch with Chloe for me. I want to see her,” Philip said coldly. George said through the phone, “Young Master, Miss Sommerset is with me right now. Do you want to come over?”</p>  <p id = > “I’ll be there,” Philip said. Then, he called a car and got to Apex Tower.</p>  <p id = > Inside the chairman’s office, Chloe was sitting on the soft sofa with her arms crossed. Her eyes were cold and they were filled with resentment. She was staring at Philip who was standing in front of her. “I haven’t seen you in seven years. You’ve changed quite a lot,” Chloe said. Her gaze looked complicated. There was surprise, jealousy, hope, and also disappointment.</p>  <h2 id =chapter-166 > Chapter 166</h2>  <p id = > Philip looked at the woman in front of him coldly. This was the woman he had wronged seven years ago. He said, “Chloe, don’t involve other people in our business. Don’t cause any trouble for my family.” Slap! Chloe got up and slapped Philip across the face. Then, she glared at him and said, “What happened between you and me will not end so easily. Don’t forget how you left me without a word and how much you’ve hurt me!” Chloe’s heart pounded when she saw Philip. After all, they had not seen each other for seven years. She had even looked forward to this. However, Philip’s eyes and expression just now betrayed how he truly felt. Chloe was a woman, so she knew how Philip was feeling. He only cared about that woman named Wynn. “Chloe, what happened seven years ago was my fault. It’s fine if you want to punish me. However, you can’t do anything to Wynn. This is my warning for you,” Philip said. If Chloe really touched Wynn, Philip would fight back without a second thought. “Warning?” Chloe laughed coldly. The gentleness in the corner of her eyes became cold. She said, “Who are you to warn me? You’re the reason I’m like this today! How dare you leave without a word seven years ago and let me suffer the humiliation and shame all alone! On what grounds?” Chloe yelled and cried until her voice was hoarse.</p>  <p id = > Tears rolled down from the corner of her eyes. They signified the despair in her heart. “Do you know how I managed to live through those seven years?</p>  <p id = > Chloe Sommerset has become a massive joke in Capital City! The Sommersets have become a joke! “And all of this was caused by you, Philip!</p>  <p id = > “You ruined me. I just want to get back what I deserve and you’re being so nervous? “Wynn? Let me tell you, Philip. As long as I am here, your life will be living hell! I will definitely break you two apart. I will!” Chloe said a lot in one breath. She looked terrifying when she talked with her teeth clenched. Philip took a deep breath and looked at Chloe. He felt remorseful.</p>  <p id = > He did not know how much hurt he had caused her after running away from that marriage. She changed. She felt foreign to Philip and he felt scared.</p>  <p id = > “I… I’m sorry. I can apologize to you. If you want anything, you can come to me. I will try my best to fulfill your wishes, but Wynn and Mila are my limits. I won’t allow them to be harmed in any way, do you understand?”</p>  <p id = > Philip said. His heated gaze was staring at Chloe. “Fulfill my wishes?”</p>  <p id = > Chloe scoffed and said, “Alright, then I want you to divorce Wynn and marry me. Can you do that?” Philip frowned, and he fell silent. Chloe laughed in self-mockery for a long while. Tears rolled down her cheeks again. “I knew it. You never loved me. Then why did you get engaged to me back then? Why?” Philip did not know how to deal with Chloe who was being hysterical. He could only let her get angry at him and hit him.</p>  <p id = > Suddenly, Chloe hugged Philip and said tearfully, “Philip, I miss you. I miss you so much. Promise me you’ll divorce that b*tch. I will listen to anything you say. I won’t cause any trouble for you and I won’t even interfere even if you find another woman out there once we’re married, okay?” This was Chloe’s love. Her love was so petty and resentful. She loved him so much until she had deviated from the meaning of love. Philip pushed Chloe away.</p>  <p id = > He wanted to say something but he stopped. Eventually, he said, “Chloe, I’m sorry.” His apology included everything he wanted to say. Chloe’s entire body went limp. The last piece of softness in her heart was completely destroyed by Philip. He even threw it on the ground and trampled on it.</p>  <p id = > Chloe wiped away her tears and chuckled coldly. She said, “I understand.</p>  <p id = > I’m just a dispensable passerby in your heart.” Philip pressed his lips</p>  <p id = > together. He wanted to explain, but in the end, he chose silence. He did not want Chloe to get hurt because of him again. He also did not want Wynn to get hurt because of him. However, the damage had already been done. He was scared that the more he explained, the more he would mess things up.</p>  <p id = > Perhaps, being straightforward was the best ending for both of them.</p>  <p id = > Chloe’s expression was icy. She stared into Philip’s eyes and asked suddenly, “Philip, does your wife know who you are?” Chloe was completely devoured by anger. She only had one goal in her heart, and it was revenge. She wanted to return the humiliation she had felt for the past seven years to Philip. She wanted him to understand that he would never be able to make up for the hurt that she endured. Philip’s pupils constricted as he frowned. He asked coldly, “What are you going to do?” Chloe took out her phone and crossed one arm across her chest. A cold smile appeared on her red lips. She said, “What do you think Wynn’s reaction will be if I tell her who you really are?” Philip’s eyes dimmed. His entire body plunged into coldness. When she said that, Chloe dialed the number that she found.</p>  <p id = > The call went through. “Hello, who’s this?” It was Wynn’s voice.</p>  <h2 id =chapter-167 > Chapter 167</h2>  <p id = > When he heard Wynn’s voice, Philip’s face fell. He stared at Chloe intensely. Chloe looked at Philip with a fake smile and said, “Hello, Wynn.</p>  <p id = > I’m Chloe.” There was silence on the other end of the phone. “How can I help you?” Wynn was a woman with a temper. It was obvious that she was mad from her cold tone. Chloe did not answer immediately. She looked at Philip and said softly, “If Wynn knows who you are, how will she react?</p>  <p id = > Have you ever thought about it?” Philip clenched his fists, his eyes heated.</p>  <p id = > His low voice sounded like the growl of a beast. He said, “Chloe Sommerset, you’re playing with fire.” Philip was nervous, but at the same time, he was furious. He did not like to be threatened! “Philip, do you not understand me?</p>  <p id = > The more exciting a game is, the more I’ll like it.” Chloe placed her hand under her chin and looked at him provocatively. Then, she said into the</p>  <p id = > phone, “Wynn, what kind of man do you think Philip is?” What kind of man Philip was? Wynn was taken aback. She answered without even thinking,</p>  <p id = > “Miss Sommerset, I don’t even know you. If you’re here because of my husband, then we can talk face to face. I’ll try my best to fulfill whatever conditions you want. However, I must warn you not to break Philip and me apart.” This was a warning from Wynn. Of course, Chloe did not expect her to answer like this. Her expression froze as she knitted her beautiful eyebrows together. She looked arrogant and icy. Chloe said coldly, “Wynn, I don’t think you know your husband that well. Have you ever looked into his past? Do you know about his family background?” “What do you mean?” Wynn was puzzled. She did not understand what Chloe was talking about. She was right. Wynn did not understand Philip all that much. Wynn did not know what Philip was like before university. She had only heard stories from Philip himself. Plus, she had never met those friends Philip mentioned. She only knew recently what Philip’s family was like and what jobs his parents had. Did Philip really run away from home as he said?</p>  <p id = > Wynn was confused. Her voice became less confident. “If you want to know about Philip’s past, come to Northern Sky Western Restaurant,” Chloe said calmly. Her eyes were glued on Philip the entire time. There was silence on the other end of the phone. Then, Wynn replied, “Okay.” After she hung up, Chloe stood proudly in front of Philip. She looked pleased as she had managed to get away with her cunning plans. She said, “You don’t look nervous at all.” Philip frowned and asked, “What are you trying to do?” He did not take action just now. He was waiting for Chloe. If she exposed him through the phone, then he would not hesitate to take action to stop this from happening. Chloe smirked and reached out a fair hand. She glided her hand across Philip’s resolute face. Her eyes were filled with love and admiration.</p>  <p id = > She said, “It’s simple. Have dinner with me tonight. We haven’t had dinner together in seven years.” Have dinner with her? Philip was enraged.</p>  <p id = > “Impossible! You’re extorting me!” Chloe smiled and said, “It’s up to you.</p>  <p id = > Plus, it’s just dinner. Why are you so nervous? Why? Are you scared that</p>  <p id = > your wife might see us together?” Chloe did not continue talking. She waited for Philip to answer her. After a while, Philip replied, “Alright, I’ll go, but I must warn you. If you expose anything about me to Wynn, I’ll make you regret this.” Philip turned around and left angrily after he said that. Chloe stood in the office alone. She watched as Philip left. Her heart started throbbing with pain. ‘Why? ‘Why do you only care about that b*tch?</p>  <p id = > ‘I can’t even compare to her?’ When he got back to the hospital, Philip ran into Wynn in front of the hospital room. Wynn glanced at Philip coldly and the latter only smiled at her before moving out of the way. They looked at each other but did not say anything. Wynn did not tell Philip about the phone call. She wanted to solve this by herself. Philip did not ask as well. They just stayed in silence and started giving each other the silent treatment.</p>  <p id = > Philip drove Wynn back in the evening. Wynn looked exhausted. She said,</p>  <p id = > “I’ll be staying with my mom for a few days.” “Why are you going there?”</p>  <p id = > Philip was worried. Wynn did not say anything. She turned her head around and did not pay attention to Philip. Philip was helpless. It was not that he did not want to tell her. He just did not know how to start the conversation.</p>  <p id = > Should he tell Wynn his real identity? Could she accept this? Was she ready to become the richest madam in the world? “Wynn, trust me. There’s nothing between me and Chloe,” Philip said suddenly. However, Wynn did not say anything. Her face was cold, and her eyes were shut. It was as if she did not want to pay attention to him. When they got to the Old Johnston Manor, the two got out of the car simultaneously. Philip wanted to help Wynn with her bag but she refused. “Mom, I’ll be staying here for a few days.” Wynn entered the house and changed her shoes. Then, she went straight into her room and slammed the door. Martha stood in the living room in confusion. She turned her head, and her face fell. She looked at Philip and asked, “Did you bully her?” Wynn did not look like she was in the right mind. Plus, she even wanted to stay here for a few days. She must have fought with Philip. Alright, very good! She had been worried that she would not have a chance to make them file for divorce, but now, here it was.</p>  <h2 id =chapter-168 > Chapter 168</h2>  <p id = > “Mom, I didn’t. Maybe Wynn’s just exhausted.” Philip explained. However, Martha did not believe him. She looked at him with the corner of her eyes and her face was as cold as stagnant water. She pointed at Philip’s nose and started shouting, “Do you think I won’t understand the daughter I gave birth to? Philip, don’t say that I never warned you. A man like you is not a match for my daughter at all! If you’re smart, you should divorce Wynn as soon as possible. Stop hindering Wynn from marrying into a rich family!” Philip was helpless when he was faced with Martha’s arrogance and bossiness.</p>  <p id = > Martha was not the only one who was annoyed. Philip was feeling frustrated as well. After being accused by Martha, Philip’s tone became slightly awful.</p>  <p id = > “Alright, I got it. Can you stop nagging? This is between me and Wynn. We will take care of this,” Philip replied coldly. There was no warmth in his eyes. Martha was shocked by that ominous glint in his eyes. Martha was enraged. How dare he talk to her like this. Did he want to die? “Philip, how can you talk to me like this? So you don’t even respect your mother-in-law anymore? Alright, how amazing. Philip Clarke, you’re really something else. Get out of my house now! Out!” Martha started pushing Philip out of the house. The world had turned upside down. A son-in-law was yelling at his mother-in-law! Philip was annoyed. He swung his hand and pushed Martha aside. Thud! “Ouch!” Martha fell backward and landed on the floor on her bottom. Then, she slapped her thigh and yelled loudly, “Charlie!</p>  <p id = > Come out here and look at this! Your darling son-in-law beat me! I can’t stay in this family any longer.” Philip was mortified. He went over to help Matha up. He said, “Mom, I’m so sorry. It was an accident.” “What do you mean it was an accident? You did this on purpose!” Martha pointed at Philip unreasonably and started hurling abuses. The argument outside caught the attention of Charles who was in the study and Wynn who was in the bedroom. They were annoyed when they came out and saw the scene before them. Charles went up to Philip and slapped him across the face. He yelled,</p>  <p id = > “Are you insane? How dare you hit your mother-in-law. I, Charles Johnston, don’t have a son-in-law like you! Get out of here now!” Wynn ran over hurriedly and helped Martha up. She glared at Philip with anger in her eyes.</p>  <p id = > “Get out of my house now! I don’t want to see you!” Philip could not explain himself in front of the wrath of the three. He looked at Wynn for a long time before turning around to leave. When Wynn saw Philip turning around, she felt a throb in her heart. She wanted to run up to him and ask for an explanation, but Martha grabbed her by the arm. “Wynn, is my tailbone broken? Take me to the hospital.” How would Martha not detect that? Wynn had only asked Philip to leave in a fit of anger. She could not let her daughter run after him now. The bigger this misunderstanding, the better. Wynn was frantic. One was her mother while the other was Philip. “Mom, don’t worry.</p>  <p id = > I’ll send you to the hospital now.” She had no choice. She had to choose her mother. After all, her mother was in so much pain that she could not even stand straight. If something happened, Philip could not bear this responsibility. When the three of them were ready to head out, they saw a handsome man in a suit outside the door. “Hello, is this the house of Martha Yates?” The man grinned. “Yes, I am Martha Yates.” Martha was holding onto Wynn for support. Her face was contorted from pain. She was so good at pretending. “Hello, Aunty. Miss Sommerset has asked me to send you these.” That man smiled. Then, seven to eight men in suits started carrying things into the house. They were all high-end luxurious goods. Gold necklaces, jade bangles, black pearls, and even some calligraphies for Charles. In addition to that, there were also two boxes of money. There were two million bucks in total! Aside from those, there was also a Maserati car key. Looking at the gifts that were being carried into her house, Martha was shocked. Wynn was also stunned. “Um… Child, are these all for us?”</p>  <p id = > Martha’s legs were turning into noodles from the shock. She was starting to stammer from excitement. Her eyes never once left those gifts. Especially the boxes filled with two million bucks. It was cold hard cash! “Yes, Aunty.</p>  <p id = > These are all from Miss Sommerset.” The man smiled. Martha could not</p>  <p id = > stand still. These were all for her! Wynn’s face fell. She could guess who was the one who sent all of these. “May I ask who Miss Sommerset is? Do I know her?” Martha was not an idiot. She grabbed the man’s hands and asked excitedly. The man replied, “Miss Sommerset is Mr. Philip Clarke’s friend.”</p>  <h2 id =chapter-169 > Chapter 169</h2>  <p id = > Philip Clarke? Martha frowned. She looked annoyed. Whenever she heard Philip’s name, she would feel as if her entire body was covered in thorns.</p>  <p id = > However, she hid that feeling in a blink of an eye. Miss Sommerset was the one who sent over all these gifts. There was precious jewelry, a car, and also cash. It was obvious that Miss Sommerset was from an affluent family.</p>  <p id = > “Um, our Philip is friends with Miss Sommerset?” Martha smiled. That man replied politely, “I don’t know the details. I’m just here to deliver the gifts.”</p>  <p id = > After he said that, the man left with his men. He came just as quickly as he left. Martha finally came back to her senses. She was rich! “Charlie, Wynn, we’re going to be rich! These… These things are worth so much money!</p>  <p id = > We also have two million bucks!” Martha was so excited that her bottom did not hurt anymore. She stared at those gifts and the two boxes of cash.</p>  <p id = > She wanted so badly to fall asleep while holding them. Charles was excited, of course. Especially when he saw those calligraphies. He could tell that they were extremely valuable. They were of good quality. They were amazing things! The two of them had fallen into the enemy’s hands. “Wynn, who is Miss Sommerset? Does she know Philip?” Martha was not an idiot.</p>  <p id = > Miss Sommerset only gave them these things because of Philip. Philip was a worthless scum, so how did he get so many wealthy friends? That kid was hiding a lot of things from them! Wynn’s face fell. She said angrily with a cold expression on her face, “Mom, Dad, return these things immediately.</p>  <p id = > We can’t accept them.” Wynn did not understand what Chloe was trying to say by doing this, but she could tell that she was displaying her power with money. Chloe Sommerset wanted to steal Philip away from her! No way in</p>  <p id = > hell! Philip was her husband and he was Mila’s father. Wynn would not admit defeat! When Martha heard that Wynn wanted to return all of these gifts, she started to make a fuss. She shrieked, “No! No! You can’t! Miss Sommerset gave me these. These are mine! They belong to me, Martha Yates! Who are you to send these back?” Martha’s eyes would only open for money. This was the snobbish Martha Yates. So what if Wynn was her daughter? Was she better than money? Martha would not return these gifts even if she had to cut off ties with her daughter. There were so many gold necklaces. Also, she had two million bucks and a Maserati. Martha never had these things before. How could she just give them back? “Mom, do you know why she gave you these?” Wynn was stomping her feet in anger. Tears were forming in her eyes. She was so unfortunate to have such a money-minded mother. “I don’t care. Wynn Johnston, I’m warning you. Miss Sommerset gave me these things, so they’re mine now. You don’t have the right to make me return them!” Martha was guarding those gifts while glaring at Wynn. “Charlie, say something. Tell me, should I return these things or not?” Martha was trying to gain more momentum with Charles.</p>  <p id = > Charles was conflicted. To be honest, he liked the two calligraphies. One of them was from Wang Xizhi! Gosh! If word got out, his ranking in the collector’s circle would go up! However, he could tell that his daughter was mad. “Martha, why don’t we return these? As the saying goes, ‘don't get a reward if it's not deserved’. Even if they are for us, we can’t take them!”</p>  <p id = > Charles still cared about his daughter. Martha exploded. She sat on the ground and wailed while slapping her thighs, “Charles Johnston, oh Charles Johnston! You’re bullying me because I don’t have the same last name as you two, right? You Johnstons are the worst! What have I gotten after getting married to you for so many years? I was blind when I got married to you, and I even gave birth to a heartless child! I’m so mad! I can’t live like this anymore! I don’t want to live anymore! “I’ll tell you guys now, I won’t return any of these things! If you dare to return these, I’ll drink insecticide and die!” When Martha started making a fuss, no one could handle her.</p>  <h2 id =chapter-170 > Chapter 170</h2>  <p id = > Wynn was crying from frustration. She stomped her feet and went back to her bedroom. Then, she slammed the door. Martha was stunned, but she shook her head while feeling pleased with herself. Then, she looked at Charles as if she was showing off. She stood up with a devilish grin on her face. She happily brought everything back to her room. After that, Martha remembered that there was something off about Philip. Miss Sommerset gave them so many expensive gifts for no reason. Plus, judging from Wynn’s reaction, they must be hiding something from her. “Charlie, what do you think is wrong with Philip? Why did Miss Sommerset send so many expensive things to us?” Martha asked. She was constantly thinking about Miss Sommerset. Why would a normal friend send them so many expensive things? It seemed that Philip and Miss Sommerset’s relationship was not that ordinary. Charles was studying his calligraphies. He answered, “You should ask Wynn. She might know.” Martha pressed her lips together and walked out of her bedroom. Coincidentally, she saw Wynn walking out of her room. She called out, “Wynn, where are you going? I have something to ask you.” Wynn ignored Martha. She pushed the door and walked away.</p>  <p id = > “That stupid girl is getting more and more out of hand. She must be getting influenced by that good-for-nothing.” Martha rolled her eyes in anger and mumbled. She had to call Philip and ask him about this. After Martha had that thought, she dialed Philip’s number, “Philip, is Miss Sommerset your friend?” Philip was in the hospital with Mila. When he heard that, he frowned instantly and asked, “Mom, did she go to your house?” “No, she</p>  <p id = > just asked someone to send some expensive things over.” Martha did not tell him what they were. She was scared that he would ask for them back if she told him. Philip was quiet. He forced out a smile and explained, “Mom, since she gave them to you, you should accept them. She’s a good friend of mine from my hometown. She came to Riverdale for a vacation.” When Martha heard that, she was pleased. She said excitedly, “Oh, Philip. You should have told me that you have a lot of rich friends. Right, just tell me what you want to eat next time. Don’t be courteous with me. Also, invite Miss Sommerset over when she’s free. I have to entertain her properly.”</p>  <p id = > Martha’s attitude changed all of a sudden. However, Philip was not surprised. She was just a person who would open her eyes to money and be easily swayed. After talking for a while, Philip hung up the phone. His expression was solemn as he called Chloe immediately. He said in a low voice, “Chloe Sommerset, what is the meaning of this?” Chloe was walking out of the parking lot when she got Philip’s call. There was a pleased smirk on her face. “Nothing. I just gave your mother-in-law a surprise since she looks down on you so much. How are things? Is she fawning over you right now? She also asked you to bring me back for dinner, right?” Philip’s eyes went dark. He looked at his daughter who was sleeping on the bed and walked out of the room. He said, “Chloe, I’m warning you. Don’t interfere with my business! Where are you?” “Why? You can’t wait to see me, can you? Aren’t you scared that your wife will be worried?” Chloe sashayed into the restaurant. “You should know how my temper is. Where are you?”</p>  <p id = > Philip’s voice turned icy. “Northern Sky Western Restaurant,” Chloe replied before hanging up. Philip was shocked! Damn Chloe! He was tricked by her. He thought she would not meet Wynn if he agreed to her request. He did not have time to think. He ran out of the hospital and called a car to Northern Sky Western Restaurant. He had to stop this meeting. At the same time. After Wynn got dressed, she arrived at Northern Sky Western Restaurant. This was the most luxurious and expensive restaurant that served western cuisine in Riverdale. There were only 17 branches in the</p>  <p id = > country. Wynn looked gorgeous tonight. When she arrived at the restaurant, she caught everyone’s attention. “Hello, I have a reservation under Miss Sommerset,” Wynn smiled and said to the hostess “Alright, please follow me.” The hostess led Wynn to the top floor where the rotating restaurant was. It was a semi-open space. She could see the night view of Riverdale while below them was a swimming pool. One would feel refreshed looking at the blue water in the pool. Chloe had booked this entire floor. Wynn saw Chloe sitting there sipping on her coffee. There was a moment where Wynn thought that Chloe was a perfect match for Philip. She did not know why.</p>  <p id = > Maybe it was because Chloe had the same habit as Philip when he was drinking his coffee. She sat down. The two of them looked at each other.</p>  <p id = > Wynn opened her mouth coldly and said, “Miss Sommerset, let’s be frank.”</p>  <p id = > Wynn was nervous. Her hands were still trembling when she placed them on her knees. It was because Chloe was exerting so much pressure on her, especially by giving her parents those expensive gifts. She was under an immense amount of stress. Chloe parted her red lips. She smiled warmly and said, “Miss Johnston, how much do you know about Philip?” Wynn replied instantly, “Philip is my husband, so of course I know him well.”</p>  <p id = > Chloe smiled slightly and looked at Wynn. The latter was a porcupine that was covered with spines. She could not wait to pledge sovereignty. “I am Philip’s fiancée,” Chloe said all of a sudden. Her eyes lacked warmth. She then took a sip of her coffee.</p>  <h2 id =chapter-171 > Chapter 171</h2>  <p id = > Philip’s fiancée? Wynn could feel her heart skip a beat. Her fair hands clenched together in fists as she grabbed her dress. She looked at Chloe in disbelief. Then, she lowered her eyes and her lips started to tremble. What was going on? She was Philip’s fiancée? Why did Philip not tell her about this? At this moment, Wynn was feeling all kinds of emotions in her heart.</p>  <p id = > It was difficult for her to calm herself down. She was so nervous that she took a big gulp of her coffee to control her emotions. Chloe smirked coldly.</p>  <p id = > She was feeling pleased with herself and it was made obvious by the smirk on her face. She continued to say, “Philip and I are childhood sweethearts.</p>  <p id = > We've known each other since we were young. Seven years ago, he left without a word at our engagement party. I didn’t expect him to be married and have a daughter seven years later,” Chloe said slowly. Each and every word she said made Wynn feel like a sinner. She had known Philip from a long time ago. They were also childhood sweethearts. Wynn was a woman, so she could understand the pain of a man leaving without a word—</p>  <p id = > especially during their engagement party. This was the ultimate humiliation for a woman. “I… I’m sorry. I’ll apologize to you on Philip’s behalf.” Wynn managed to say this after a long while. Her eyes were already wet with tears.</p>  <p id = > She had already put up her armor, but now, she was collapsing and falling apart. Wynn did not know how she should fight this anymore. After all, her opponent was Chloe. “You said you know Philip, but did he ever tell you about me?” Chloe asked. Wynn shook her head and did not dare to look at Chloe. The wind messed up her hair. Chloe shook her head helplessly and said, “I didn’t think that he’d hide this from you. I wonder what he’s thinking.” “What do you mean?” Wynn could detect the hidden meaning in this. Chloe looked at the other party coldly. She was looking at her like she was examining her. There was also pity in her eyes. She said, “Do you really think Philip is the man you see in your daily life? He’s always quiet and has to suffer mockery and humiliation from your family every day. In front of all of you, he has become a spineless coward.” Wynn did not say anything.</p>  <p id = > She had already predicted this. Philip was not the spineless coward that she thought he was. His huge transformation recently proved that. “Philip told me his family runs a business. He told me that he ran away from home.”</p>  <p id = > Wynn wanted to get the upper hand. She told Chloe that in a serious tone, but she sounded guilty. Chloe smiled. She was smiling in an icy and exaggerated manner. “You believe him?” Chloe asked. “What if I tell you that the Clarkes own this restaurant and that this restaurant belongs to Philip.</p>  <p id = > Will you still believe him?” The Clarkes owned this restaurant? How was</p>  <p id = > that possible? This was the Northern Sky Western Restaurant. There were only 17 in the entire country! They had assets up to a few billion! Wynn frowned. She was extremely nervous and curious. What was Philip hiding from her? Chloe continued slowly. “I don’t think you know him all that much. I don’t know what qualifications a woman like you have to be Philip’s wife.” She was mocking and humiliating Wynn deviously. Wynn lowered her head even further. Tears started rolling down her eyes uncontrollably.</p>  <p id = > “I’m sorry, I need to go to the restroom.” Wynn ran to the restroom and broke down. She finally calmed down after a few minutes. She touched up her makeup and walked out to continue talking with Chloe. Chloe could tell Wynn had been crying. The arrogance on her face did not diminish. She said, “Wynn, in these seven years, you’ve just been a toy to Philip. You don’t even know what his family does nor who he is. And you still have the guts to say that you know him? Do you think Philip really loves you? “I, Chloe Sommerset, am Philip Clarke’s future. I have what you don’t have. I knew Philip since we were young and I know everything about him. Plus, we have a wedding contract. Even if he left without saying anything, it’s still in effect. “Wynn, divorce Philip. I can give you everything you want,”</p>  <p id = > Chloe said sentence by sentence. She became more and more overbearing.</p>  <p id = > She took out a black card from her purse and said, “Here’s 30 million. You’ll get another 30 million once you divorce Philip.” Wynn grabbed her dress tightly. She lifted her head and had a serious expression on her face. She said, “Miss Sommerset, thank you for telling me all these. However, I have to tell you that Philip is my husband and he’s also Mila’s father. I won’t give him up no matter what you say.” After she said that, Wynn got up and walked out of the restaurant. Chloe sat on her seat and faced the wind. She looked at the tallest building not far away. It was the Apex Tower. She muttered, “Wynn, do you know that the tower over there belongs to Philip as well? How will a stupid woman like you be Philip’s perfect match?”</p>  <p id = > Chloe took out her phone after she said that and called a number. She said coldly, “Do it well. I don’t want to leave any traces behind.” A deep</p>  <p id = > masculine voice replied on the other end of the phone, “Don’t worry, Miss Sommerset. We’ll definitely do it perfectly. I’ll ask my men to tarnish her tonight.” Chloe hung up the phone instantly. There was no warmth in her eyes. ‘Wynn, don’t blame me for doing this. ‘You shouldn’t be with Philip.</p>  <p id = > He belongs only to me, Chloe Sommerset. ‘I will personally destroy anyone who gets close to Philip.’</p>    <h2 id =chapter-172 > Chapter 172</h2>  <p id = > Wynn walked down from the top floor lifelessly and miserably. She could not stop the tears that were rolling down her cheeks. Why? Why did Philip hide this from her? She felt hurt and betrayal that she had never felt before.</p>  <p id = > Wynn started to question herself. Was she just one of Philip’s toys? She felt that Chloe was too domineering. She was not her opponent at all. What should she do? How should she face this? Wynn felt exhausted. She started walking with no destination in mind. At this time, a group of people who looked like thugs began following behind her. They had received the signal</p>  <p id = > and been waiting on the first floor for a very long time. They looked at each other while rubbing their fists before heading over to Wynn quickly. “Hey pretty lady, you’re looking hot. Your skin is so fair and your legs are so slender. Daddy likes women like you. Why isn’t there a man with you? Do you want to have a drink with me and the boys?” “Why is a pretty lady like you crying? Who bullied you? Tell me and I’ll kill him for you.” The thugs followed Wynn and verbally assaulted her. They were also trying to touch her and bring her to their private room. A few customers and servers saw this. They were furious. However, they did not dare to say anything. These thugs were well-known for their trouble making in this area. They even got incarcerated a few times before. However, there were still some who wanted to be the hero. They too had ulterior motives. “What are you doing? Let go of her and get out!” a man in a suit yelled ostentatiously. One of the thugs glanced at the man in disdain and kicked him in the stomach. He said coldly,</p>  <p id = > “Didn’t you see us doing something important here? Where the f*ck did you get the courage to pretend to be a hero? Do you want to die?” The man in the suit was strong in appearance but weak in reality. He was sent flying after that kick. He grabbed his stomach and groaned. His forehead was covered in cold sweat. When the others saw what happened, they ran away in fear. “Hehe, pretty lady. Let’s go. Come and have fun with us.” The leader of the thugs put his arm on Wynn’s shoulder. Wynn turned around and yelled angrily, “Get lost! Don’t touch me!” Her face was filled with fear.</p>  <p id = > Wynn’s face was dark. There were five people in the group. A weak woman like her was no match for them. However, she would not allow them to tarnish her like this. She grabbed her bag and started swinging it randomly.</p>  <p id = > She yelled, “Get lost! If you don’t, I’ll call the police!” Smack! The chain of the bag hit Doug’s face. He was the leader of the thugs. There was a bloody red line on his face. At that moment, Doug was furious. He touched his face and shouted, “F*ck you! You f*cking b*tch! How dare you be ungrateful toward us!” Slap! Doug landed a loud slap on Wynn’s face. He used all his might on this slap, making Wynn fall to the ground upon impact.</p>  <p id = > She knocked her head on the wall and collapsed onto the floor while feeling woozy. The thugs looked at each other and laughed loudly. Wynn’s face went pale from fear after she heard those words. She watched as the thugs walked over to her and started struggling. “Don’t come over! Stop! My husband is here and he won’t forgive all of you!” Philip was the only one in Wynn’s head now. How would she live if she was tarnished by these men?</p>  <p id = > “Husband? Your spineless coward of a husband is famous for being spineless and you expect him to save you? Where is he? Where the hell is he?” Doug smirked coldly and tilted his head. He was telling his men to take action. “Let go of me! Philip! Philip!” Wynn started struggling with all her might. “F*ck!” Doug went over and slapped her a few times. His slaps landed on Wynn’s face heavily. She was starting to see stars. She lost all ability to fight back. At this moment, Philip rushed into the restaurant hurriedly. When he saw what was happening, his eyes went wide as anger took over his body. This anger could burn this entire restaurant to the ground. “Let her go!” Philip’s roar was earth-shattering. It caused the hall of the restaurant to vibrate! When Philip saw Wynn, his eyes went red. He rushed over and grabbed two of the thugs. He quickly threw punches to their faces. Then, he ran over and kicked Doug on his waist. Doug was sent flying before he landed on the ground with a loud thud. It was unknown if he was still alive. Philip grabbed Wynn while his entire body trembled. When he saw the wounds on Wynn’s face, an uncontainable murderous intention rose and devoured the entire restaurant. “Philip, w-was she telling the truth?</p>  <p id = > About her being your fiancée.” Wynn leaned against Philip, her entire body shaking. Tears rolled down her cheeks like a string of broken pearls. She was sobbing quietly. She grabbed Philip’s hand tightly while her face was covered in tear tracks. She said aggrievedly, “Please, Philip, just tell me.</p>  <p id = > Tell me, who are you?” Philip sucked in a deep breath and looked at Wynn gently. He said solemnly, “Alright, I’ll tell you.”</p>  <h2 id =chapter-173 > Chapter 173</h2>  <p id = > Philip held Wynn in his arms. His eerie eyes reflected a coldness that would wreak havoc. He would be going on a rampage today. He would make these people pay the most horrible price they could ever think of! “Wynn, wait for me. Let me take care of this and we’ll talk when we go back, okay?” The kindness in Philip’s eyes caressed Wynn’s face gently. “Alright,” said Wynn. She nodded, her eyes filled with trust for Philip. This man was her husband. He was her guardian for the rest of her life. Why would she not believe him? Should she waver just because of what Chloe said? Wynn did not want to know who Philip was nor what the Clarkes did for a living. As long as Philip stayed with her, everything would be fine. Even if Philip did not want to tell her, she would not force him. He must have his own difficulties. She was willing to wait for the day when Philip would willingly open up to her. “Doug? Doug, are you okay?” The thugs got up and surrounded Doug. Then, they helped him up. Doug’s front teeth were broken and his mouth was filled with blood. His nose was also bloody from the impact. “F*ck! Why are you still standing here? Kill him!” Doug clutched his face. He was in so much pain that he could not stand up straight. Doug Moseby had never been so humiliated before. He was defeated by an ordinary young man. Damn it! Philip was carrying Wynn to one side. Then, he got up slowly. His coldness started spreading across the room with him in the center. “All of you deserve to die!” he roared. Philip ran over and grabbed a wooden chair. Then, he smashed it down on the head of one of the thugs. Smash! The wooden chair exploded and the thug screamed in pain. His head split open as he fell in a puddle of his own blood. The scene looked horrendous. Then, Philip took advantage of his proximity and did a fighting stance. In a blink of an eye, he swung his fist and it landed straight on Doug’s face. Doug did not notice how he did it before he felt a cold breeze slapping his face. Then, a fist smashed into his face. In an instant, his nose suffered a hard hit once again. Splat! The blood started spurting out from his nose. Doug yelled in pain as he fell from the impact. The rest of the thugs were taken aback. They were all stunned. ‘Who am I? Where am</p>  <p id = > I? What am I doing?’ They were all thinking that in their hearts. However…</p>  <p id = > Bang, bang, bang! In less than a minute, all of them fell to the floor after being attacked by Philip. None of them could get up. Hiss! A few customers and servers sucked in cold breaths when they saw that. They felt numbness on the top of their heads. Amazing! That was brilliant! Was that a normal human? “F*ck me! That man is s-savage!” “That’s Doug Moseby! He’s in deep trouble now.” “Oh no! Get the manager! Tell him his brother Doug has been attacked!” While the rest of them were still in shock, a waiter ran out hurriedly. Doug being attacked was a colossal piece of news! At this moment, there were a few people in the crowd who were staring at Philip.</p>  <p id = > One of them was Ruby. She was meeting up with a few friends here for dinner. When she saw Philip flipping out, she was shocked. “Is he really a coward? Why is he so strong?” Ruby was confused. She also felt alarmed and anxious. The last time she asked Tiger to teach Philip a lesson, they returned without achievements. She was even scolded fiercely by Tiger. In the end, he dumped her. He did not tell her why, but he only said that if she dared to cause trouble for Philip again, she would have to pay the price.</p>  <p id = > Hmph! Would a coward turn the world upside down? “Ruby, is that really that Philip you were talking about?” “That man is so savage! He looks manly!” “So what? He’s beating up Doug. Doug is the brother of the manager of Northern Sky Western Restaurant! He’s done for!” Ruby and her friends were all looking at Philip with detest. Ruby’s eyebrows were knitted together. She took out her phone in secret and took a photo of Philip in action. At the same time, Philip swung his hands. His face was dark, and it was obvious he was pissed. That was alright. He had learned some skills from Reed Williams last time. He just did not expect that he would be able to use those skills one day. Philip did not want to expose that he was good at fighting, but now, he just wanted to release his anger! Philip approached Doug without saying anything and lifted his leg. Then, he stomped down on Doug’s stomach before lifting his fist to hit Doug on the chin. Thud! Doug’s</p>  <p id = > tooth flew out. He started puking blood. However, these were not even worth a fraction of what they deserved for harming Wynn.</p>  <h2 id =chapter-174 > Chapter 174</h2>  <p id = > “You… You brat! How dare you hit me! You’re digging your own grave!”</p>  <p id = > Doug was looking at Philip with fear. He said viciously, “My brother is Michael Moseby! He’s the manager of this restaurant!” Thud! Philip kicked him again. This time, he kicked him on his stomach. The latter screamed and curled up in pain. His face turned extremely red. Half of Doug’s kidney was about to be destroyed from that kick. “I’m going to ask you once, who ordered you to do this?” Philip’s face was dark. He grabbed Doug’s hair and growled. Doug was stubborn. He laughed a few times with blood in his mouth. He said, “Hehe, no one ordered me. I just saw your hot wife and wanted to f*ck her, so what?” Smack! Philip swung his hand and slapped Doug once more. After that, Doug’s brain started buzzing. “Who ordered you?” Philip shouted again. There was a murderous glint in his eyes. Doug was as stubborn as a mule. He lifted his head and laughed lamentably. “Your wife is smoking hot. Her body is so sexy. I’m sure you can’t satisfy her, right? Why don’t we team up?” Slam! Philip continued to beat Doug up.</p>  <p id = > “Stop it!” At this moment, a roar sounded from the entrance of the hall. A fat middle-aged man and his men barged in with high spirits. When the servers in the restaurant saw the man, they bowed respectfully and called out, “Manager Moseby!” Michael Moseby was here! When Michael saw that his brother was being beaten horribly, he was livid. “Who are you? Why are you hitting my brother?” Michael’s face was dark, and the flesh next to his mouth was jiggling. The men behind him surrounded the restaurant in a blink of an eye. The people who were not involved were being kept out of this. Philip put down Doug who was half-dead and stood up. He placed his hands into his pockets and looked at Michael calmly. He snorted slightly before saying, “So you’re the manager of this restaurant?” Michael was infuriated. He yelled, “That’s right! I am the manager, Michael Moseby!</p>  <p id = > You’re creating a ruckus in my territory and you even hurt my brother. How do you want to die?” His tone was icy. There was no room for discussion.</p>  <p id = > Michael had decided to teach this guy a lesson! If he did not, how could he keep his position as the manager? How would he continue to stay in Riverdale? Philip took out a cigarette and lit it. Then, he said in an undisturbed manner, “Your territory? Hehe, I want to see what you can do to me.” Everyone was taken aback. They did not expect this young man to be so rude and impetuous. He did not know what was good for him. This was Michael Moseby they were talking about. He was well-known in these streets. He had people working for him. Plus, he was rich and powerful. At this moment, the crowd started to gossip among themselves. “I told you he’s done for. He has offended the Moseby brothers. He won’t make it out alive even if he has ten lives.” “Looks like he’s that woman’s husband. Sigh, how arrogant. Does he want to fight the ten of them himself?” “He’s just a hothead. He’ll definitely be disabled after this. That woman will be taken away by the Moseby brothers after this. That’s too bad.” Ruby blinked. She had been videoing the scene before her the entire time. She frowned helplessly. Philip did not know what was good for him. How dare he challenge Michael? He was clearly asking for death. However, that was fine too. He should suffer some hardship. She would treat this as her revenge.</p>  <p id = > When she thought about this, Ruby’s eyes were starting to fill with intense disdain and contempt. She was also rejoicing in Philip’s misfortune. When Michael heard what Philip said, he was taken aback. Then, he guffawed sinisterly and said, “Alright, you’re a spicy one, kid. I want to see if you have more bones than the normal human!” Wynn had been watching by the side the entire time. She was scared and anxious. When she was about to get up, Philip turned around and smiled softly at her. “It’s fine, just stay there and rest. You’ll see the other side of your husband today.” Wynn was shocked. However, she sat back down when she saw the confidence in Philip’s eyes. For some unknown reason, she felt safe when she looked at</p>  <p id = > Philip. It was as if there was nothing to be scared of since he was here.</p>  <p id = > Another side of him? What was it?</p>  <h2 id =chapter-175 > Chapter 175</h2>  <p id = > Michael’s eyes twitched. The two of them were flirting with each other in front of him. They were not respecting him at all! Damn it! How dare they look down on him? Michale was furious. He pointed at Philip and shouted,</p>  <p id = > “Kid, don’t blame me for being vicious. You asked for all of these! Go!</p>  <p id = > Cripple him and take that woman away!” More than ten of Michael’s thugs approached Philip while smirking. Could one man defeat more than ten of them? He overestimated his ability. A few people in the crowd were shaking their heads and sighing helplessly. That was it. That kid was done for. That was Michael Moseby. He was well-known for being cruel. Whenever someone crossed him, it would be as if they had crossed a mad dog. He would target you your entire life. However, Philip was calm in dealing with this. He took out his phone slowly and dialed a number. Then, he said coldly,</p>  <p id = > “Jim, when are you getting here? I’m being blocked by your manager at your restaurant.” At the same time, a middle-aged man in a black suit was running to the entrance of the restaurant after he got out of his Land Rover.</p>  <p id = > He said frantically, “Young Master, I’ll be there in a second. I’m at the entrance now.” Slam! Philip hung up the phone. Jim Winger’s back was drenched in sweat and so was his forehead. 20 minutes ago, he got Philip’s call. He told him to come to the restaurant to stop a woman named Wynn Johnston. However, he was hindered by the traffic jam. Now, the young master was being blocked by his manager and his men in his restaurant. That bloody manager was provoking the almighty! Oh damn! Oh damn! Jim was starting to sweat from fear. He knew Michael. He only hired him as the manager because he was dabbling with the dark side. “Damn you, Michael.</p>  <p id = > If you offend the young master, you won’t be able to pay for it with his life.”</p>  <p id = > Jim wiped away his sweat and ran into the restaurant. Michael saw Philip making the call and started guffawing. “Well, well, well. You even know</p>  <p id = > my boss, kid. I think I underestimated you.” Michael’s eyes were piercing.</p>  <p id = > He did not think that the man in front of him would know his boss. However, so what? Philip was dressed so ordinarily. How could he be someone powerful? Mr. Winger would not argue with him because of Philip. Michael was secure in the knowledge that he had support. Philip was calm. He looked at Michael indifferently and said, “I have to correct one mistake of yours.” “What mistake?” Michael frowned. “Are you trying to stall this, kid? Alright, I want to know what mistake I’ve made.” Michael was not in a hurry. His face was contorted from his malicious grin. He did not mind this at all. This loser was just a dumb*ss. Would he really be a threat to him?</p>  <p id = > “Actually, this is not your territory. It’s mine,” Philip said quietly. His eyes were heated and they were glued on Michael. This restaurant was his. The 17 restaurants in this country were all his. Michael was stunned. Then, he threw his head back and laughed. “F*ck me! What did you say? This is your territory? Who gave you the confidence to be such a poser?” This guy was really something else. He had the guts to be so ostentatious in front of everybody. What did he mean by ‘his territory’? Was he trying to say that Northern Sky Western Restaurant was his? Preposterous! This was such a joke! Philip shook his head and smiled. Death was near at hand for Michael but he did not know what was happening. Michael saw Philip’s smile. What did that mean? Was that guy laughing at him? Damn it! Why was he smiling like that? “I don’t care who you are. You hit my brother today and you’ve caused such a huge ruckus. I must destroy you!” Michael yelled and waved his hand. Then, more than ten of his men shouted and were about to charge at him. Everyone closed their eyes. They did not dare to see what would happen next. It was obvious who was going to win. There would be no chance for things to turn for the better. Ruby lost interest in watching, so she left with her friends. Suddenly! “Stop it! Everyone, f*cking stop this immediately!” A loud yell came from the entrance of the restaurant.</p>  <p id = > Everyone turned their gaze over and saw a middle-aged man. He was running while sweating profusely. He had a frantic expression on his face.</p>  <p id = > “Boss, why are you here? Don’t worry, I can take care of this.” Michael recognized Jim immediately. He said with a smile on his face.</p>  <h2 id =chapter-176 > Chapter 176</h2>  <p id = > Jim did not come to the restaurant much. Most of the time, he just let Michael handle this place. As Jim could not watch over Michael since he was so far away, Michael’s prestige in the restaurant naturally became higher and higher over time. However, in front of Jim, he was just a little boy. “Oh no, Mr. Winger is here!” “Hehe, I’m sure that kid won’t be able to escape now. He’s such an idiot!” “Who told him to be so arrogant just now? He might be able to solve this by apologizing and offering compensation. I’m sure Mr. Winger will not forgive him.” Doug was being helped up from the ground. His face was covered in blood. When he saw Jim, he acted like he just saw his savior. He wailed and said, “Sir, you have to help me! That kid made me this way. He’s too savage!” However, reality exceeded everyone’s expectations. Jim did not pay attention to the Moseby brothers. Who were Doug and Michael Moseby? They were only excrement and trash to him now. Jim would not hesitate to punish anyone who crossed his young master, even if they were his family. They did not know the young master’s method, but Jim knew. This restaurant belonged to the young master, so how could Jim uphold justice for Doug? Slap! Jim swung his hand and slapped Doug across the face heavily. He was adding one disaster on top of another! Doug had finally stopped his nose from bleeding, but now, blood was spurting from it once again. Everyone was shocked! They did not understand what was going on. Michale was stunned. What the f*ck was happening? Then, Jim kicked Doug on the knees. He roared angrily,</p>  <p id = > “Kneel!” Doug was puzzled. In his opinion, Jim should be here to help them.</p>  <p id = > Why did Jim ask him to kneel? “Jimmy, you…” Slap! A slap landed on Michael’s face. Jim pointed at Michael’s nose angrily. He snorted, “Michael Moseby, don’t f*cking try to claim relations with me. Who’s Jimmy?</p>  <p id = > You’re just a dog that I hired!” Jim knew clearly that he could not lose</p>  <p id = > everything because of the mistakes of the Moseby brothers. Plus, they had crossed the young master, which meant they were digging for their own graves. It would depend on Philip’s mood whatever he wanted to do with them. No one could stop him. “Jimmy, what do you mean? I’m the manager of this restaurant. Plus, that idiot is the one making a ruckus. He even hurt my brother and my men. Why are you punishing us instead?” Michael’s eyes were sharp. He clenched his fists tightly. What the f*ck was wrong with Jim? He had changed his attitude toward them so fast. This never happened before! Everyone saw what happened and all of them were confused. “Manager? I gave you your position! Michael, you’re fired!” Jim roared. Michael was really digging his own grave. Fired? Michael’s pupils constricted. He was enraged. He said slowly, “Jim, are you really firing me?” However, Jim ignored him. He turned his head and bowed respectfully to Philip. He said, “Master Clarke, I’m so sorry. It’s all my fault. I failed to educate them and hired such a fool. How are you going to punish them? Just tell me and I’ll get it done.” M-master Clarke? Jim called him Master Clarke? Everyone was shocked. They were puzzled. A normal guy like him was able to make the boss of Northern Sky Western Restaurant bow down to him? Was he that amazing? Wynn sat at one side where she saw everything. Her eyes were filled with surprise. Her mouth was gaping slightly, and her eyes were glistening. Was this Philip’s other side that he mentioned? She suddenly remembered that Chloe told her that the Clarkes owned this restaurant. With this, Wynn felt relieved. However, she was still in disbelief. The husband that she had been sleeping in the same bed with was rich?! Now, Wynn was sure that Philip’s family owned restaurants.</p>  <p id = > When she thought about this, she decided not to ask Philip about the matter anymore. Even though she was still curious, but so what? Time would explain to her everything including whether Philip was a coward and what kind of person Philip was. As long as Philip opened up to her, she would be willing to listen. However, what Wynn did not know was that the level of wealth she guessed was just a drop in the ocean compared to how much</p>  <p id = > Philip actually had. At this moment, Michael and his men’s faces fell. They did not expect this ordinary man to have such a powerful background. They did not expect him to be able to make Jim bow down. Oh no! They were in big trouble. “Jim, they harassed my wife just now. You should know what to do,” Philip said flatly.</p>  <h2 id =chapter-177 > Chapter 177</h2>  <p id = > Jim felt a bone-piercing chill after he heard that sentence. The young master was livid. Jim nodded furiously. He had a nervous expression on his face when he said, “Got it!” Then, he turned around and kicked Michael’s stomach. Michael fell on his face. Jim shouted at Michael indifferently,</p>  <p id = > “Michael Moseby, from now on, you’re not the manager of my restaurant!”</p>  <p id = > Michael was furious. He was shaking all over. “F*ck you! Jim Winger, don’t think that I won’t do anything to you because you fired me! I have more than ten men here! Do you think you’ll be able to handle it if we start rioting?” Michael was savage. He was relying on having more people on his side. Then, he stood up from the ground and rubbed his stomach. When he said that, his men approached them. His men were trying to force them to submit. Jim’s face was dark as he shouted to Michael’s men, “Are you blind? Don’t you know who I am? Jim Winger! If anyone dares to take one more f*cking step, I’ll kill their entire family!” Jim’s face was icy, but there was a fire flickering in his eyes. If he could not perform well in front of his young master, he could just pack up and f*ck off. When they saw Jim in his furious state, they were scared. They looked at each other and did not dare to approach him. “You good-for-nothings!” Jim yelled. When he was about to call for backup, Philip came forward and said something in his ear. In an instant, Jim walked away. Michael and his men were shocked when they saw this. What did this mean? “What are you doing?” Michael could feel that this was not that simple. Philip smiled lightly and looked at Michael and his men. He said slowly, “Let me ask you guys, what kind of benefits do Michael usually give you?” “What… What do you mean?” Michael and</p>  <p id = > his men were stunned. They looked at each other, not knowing what Philip meant. Philip placed his hands in his pockets calmly. He said nonchalantly,</p>  <p id = > “Are you deaf or mute? Do you not understand what I’m saying?” “We…</p>  <p id = > We’re just trying to get by. Mike gives me 1,000 bucks per month. He’ll also bring us for massages and have fun with call girls.” One of the more timid men blurted out subconsciously when he saw Philip’s face. They were all shaken to the core when they saw Philip. Plus, they were scared after seeing Jim being so respectful toward him. “Hehe, Michael, I didn’t think that you were so stingy. 1,000 bucks? Are you even fit to be their leader?”</p>  <p id = > Philip scoffed in detest. At the same time, Jim came back. There were two servers behind him. They were holding two gigantic plastic bags. Everyone looked over as Philip took the plastic bags. Then, he threw the bags in front of everyone. In an instant, everyone’s eyes went wide. Money! They were all money! 100 dollar bills! There were about 500,000 to 600,000 bucks here! Philip kicked a wad of cash to the feet of the person who spoke up and said, “40,000. It’s your reward. You’ll be able to get as many women as you want in any massage parlor you go to tonight. Take this money and get lost.”</p>  <p id = > “Um…” That person who answered earlier was stunned. He was in disbelief. He looked at the wads of cash on the floor while trembling all over. He was super excited. He could not wait to pick it up! That was 40,000! He could not even make that much in a year! Philip was just giving all this away? Just because he answered one of his questions? He did not even hesitate. He bent down and picked up the money. Then, he smiled excitedly and started praising. “T-thank you, Master Clarke!” That man was so excited that his voice changed. He kept on bowing to Philip before running off with his money. Then, Philip boldly kicked over more wads of cash in front of everyone. He managed to kick over a few wads at a time. It was as if he was just fooling around. Philip did not need to say anything. All of Michael’s men bent down and started to pick up the money. “Thank you, Master Clarke!” “Thanks, Master Clarke!” In less than one minute, the men that Michael was relying on were all gone. When the tree toppled, the</p>  <p id = > monkeys scattered. They would not turn their backs away from cold hard cash.</p>  <h2 id =chapter-178 > Chapter 178</h2>  <p id = > The customers who were watching the scene unfold all sucked in huge breaths. He was so savage! This was the first time they witnessed someone playing around with money like this. What a nouveau riche! Was this how rich people did things? They were so envious. It was difficult for someone to not feel jealous of a rich man when he was acting like this. However, Ruby and her friends missed out on this. If they had seen it, how would they fawn over Philip? Ruby would definitely dump Howard with no hesitation.</p>  <p id = > Then, she would try to seduce Philip. At this point, Michael was shaking all over. He could not believe what he just saw. All of his men left him for tens of thousands of dollars. That kid was so rich! Michael was frantic. He was scared. What kind of person did his brother offend? Philip stared at the panicking Michael and said, “What do you think I’ll do to you?” Michael started sweating buckets when he heard that. Thud! In an instant, Michael knelt on the ground and started kowtowing to Philip repeatedly. He said,</p>  <p id = > “Master Clarke, I was wrong. I was confused. I failed to recognize your greatness. Please forgive me. Please forgive my brother.” Thud, thud, thud!</p>  <p id = > The sounds of Michael banging his head against the floor echoed. Doug was at one side, and he was limp all over. When he saw Philip throwing money around like it was nothing, he understood that he would die here tonight.</p>  <p id = > When he looked in front of him, the pair of simple sports shoes that Philip was wearing looked a little dirty. He lifted his head in fear and saw that icy face. He immediately knelt and begged, “Master… Master Clarke, I was wrong. I was blind. I shouldn’t have harassed your wife. I was wrong. I deserve to die. Please punish me.” He looked like the ministers during ancient times who would yell ‘I should die a thousand deaths!’ However, Doug did deserve to die a thousand deaths. Philip looked at him coldly and said to Jim, “Take good care of them. I don’t want to see them talk while</p>  <p id = > standing.” Jim nodded instantly and said, “Roger, Young Master.” “Master Clarke, Master Clarke! Please forgive me! Please forgive my brother!”</p>  <p id = > Michael knelt on the ground and kowtowed repeatedly. His forehead was covered in blood from the repeated actions. “Who are you? How dare you beg Master Clarke. You should know the consequences of offending Master Clarke!” Jim went over and kicked him. Philip turned around and ignored everything. Behind him, Michael roared tyrannically, “Philip Clarke, I’ll never forgive you!” After he said that, Jim went over and kicked him again.</p>  <p id = > “You reckless fool! How dare you threaten Young Master. You’re really digging your own grave!” Philip stopped in his tracks and sighed. He said coldly, “Jim, I don’t want to see them in Riverdale ever again.” After he said that, he walked over to Wynn. “Come, let’s go home.” Philip carried Wynn bridal style and walked out of the restaurant under everyone’s terrified and envious gazes. Wynn curled up in Philip’s arms. Her slender arms circled around Philip’s neck. Her eyes were red. There was love and adoration in her eyes when she looked at Philip. Then, she planted a quick kiss on his lips. “Thank you,” Wynn said as soft as a mosquito. She was blushing furiously. Philip was stunned. His cold eyes softened immediately.</p>  <p id = > He looked at Wynn gleefully and said, “I’m your husband.” Everyone still could not dispel what had happened even after Philip carried Wynn away.</p>  <p id = > At the same time, Chloe walked down from upstairs. Her face was icy. A suffocating cold glint was emitting from her beautiful eyes. “Miss Sommerset, please help me.” When Doug saw Chloe, he wanted to pounce at her. However, Chloe’s bodyguard kicked him away immediately. He was slammed against the wall with a loud thud. It was unknown whether he was still alive or not. “Miss,” the bodyguard lowered his head and said respectfully. Chloe looked at the unconscious Doug and said coldly, “Take care of him. I don’t want Philip to know that I have something to do with this.” “Yes, Miss.” On the way home, Philip and Wynn sat in the cab. Wynn was leaning against Philip the entire time. She could feel his broad chest and heartbeat. She had a lot of questions in her heart. “Philip, does your family</p>  <p id = > own Northern Sky Western Restaurant?” Wynn asked. She was sure that Philip’s family ran restaurants. That would explain why Philip was a good cook. Philip nodded and said, “Yeah, it belongs to my father.” After being quiet for a while, Philip decided to tell Wynn. He said, “Wynn, actually, my family…”</p>  <h2 id =chapter-179 > Chapter 179</h2>  <p id = > However, before he could continue, Wynn shifted her body and found a more comfortable position. Then, she grabbed Philip’s waist and closed her eyes. “I’m tired.” Philip stopped talking. He held her with his right hand and the two fell into silence. It had been a long while since he was this intimate with Wynn. How should he tell Wynn about who he was? Maybe he should find another chance. Philip got out of the car and carried Wynn back to the Old Johnston Manor. Martha was excited today. She had never seen so many gold and silver jewelry before. There were also two million in cash. Martha wanted to sleep while holding the dollar bills. “Eh, you’re back? What’s wrong with Wynn?” When Martha heard the knocking on the door, she opened the door and saw Philip carrying Wynn. Philip carried Wynn into her room and removed her heels and coat for her. Then, he sat at the head of the bed with adoration in his eyes. He was watching Wynn who was sleeping soundly. Her nicely-done eyebrows were knitted together slightly.</p>  <p id = > One could tell how stressed she was. “Wynnie, one of these days, you’ll know who I am. When that happens, you’ll be the happiest woman on earth.</p>  <p id = > Mila will also become the happiest little princess,” Philip said quietly and caressed Wynn’s cheek with his hand. The gentleness in his eyes was proof of his undying love for Wynn. He leaned down and kissed Wynn gently on the forehead. When Philip was about to get out of the room, Wynn grabbed his hand. Her eyes were wide open, twinkling. She asked, “Philip, will your parents like me?” Wynn was worried. Philip’s family owned Northern Sky Western Restaurant. This would mean that they were loaded. Would her rich in-laws like a normal woman like her? Would she bring shame to Philip’s</p>  <p id = > family? Philip leaned down and patted Wynn’s hand. He said, “Don’t worry, my parents will definitely like you. I’ll take you to see them when we have time.” Wynn nodded and closed her eyes. There was a small smile on her lips. She managed to get rid of all of her negative thoughts. The happiest woman on earth? She was willing to believe Philip. Ten minutes later, Philip got out of the bedroom quietly. Then, Martha grabbed him impatiently and forced him to sit down in the living room. She poured him a cup of tea and smiled flatteringly. “Philip, tell me. Are you close to Miss Sommerset?”</p>  <p id = > Martha had been wondering about Chloe and Philip’s relationship the entire day. How would such a wealthy person know a good-for-nothing like Philip? There must be something she did not know. “We’re okay,” Philip replied flatly. How would he not know what Martha meant? She must be planning something again. Philip was tired of having a mother-in-law like this. Martha had been alive for so long. How could she not get what he was trying to say? She could tell that Philip did not want to tell her. He was just being perfunctory. Her face fell as she snatched away the cup Philip was holding. She poured its content into the bin and said in frustration, “Don’t drink this if you’re not going to tell me. This is for humans, not a disobedient dog.” ‘What the hell? Your mother-in-law is asking you a question and you’re still trying to make faces at me.’ Martha was enraged. Philip was awkward. He touched his nose and got up. He said, “Um, I’ll be heading back now.” Martha did not like him and was biased against him. It would be suffering if he continued to stay here, so he should just leave as soon as possible. “Go. Hurry up and leave. I get mad looking at you.” Martha did not plan to entertain Philip anymore. She said coldly while waving her hand.</p>  <p id = > Philip refused to tell her, so she should just go and ask Wynn. Her daughter would not lie to her, right? After Philip left his mother-in-law’s place, he went to the hospital to accompany Mila. With Henry’s treatment plan, Mila’s body was recovering well. She could undergo surgery next week.</p>  <p id = > After Mila recovered, he planned to take Wynn and Mila back home. They had to see his family eventually. At that point, his identity would finally be</p>  <p id = > exposed. The only thing Philip was worried about was that woman at home.</p>  <p id = > In the middle of the night, Philip got out of the hospital room to find a place to smoke. Suddenly! Two men in suits approached him from behind. They respectfully stood more than a meter away from Philip. They said, “Young Master, Madam has asked you to go back.” Philip frowned. His face turned cold instantly. The time finally came.</p>  <h2 id =chapter-180 > Chapter 180</h2>  <p id = > After being silent for a while, Philip threw away his cigarette. He walked out of the hospital and got into a Benz that was parked in front of the entrance. The car drove slowly in the night, passing the main road of Riverdale. Then, it crossed Scarlet Bridge and went into the darkness of the hillside. After that, it drove along the mountainous road and stopped at a manor at the peak of Mount Cirrus. Cirrus Manor. It was the most extravagant and valuable manor in Riverdale. The construction cost alone was one billion bucks! They had hollowed half of the mountain for this manor. Construction started seven years ago. It took three years to finish. A lot of manpower, resources, and money were spent on this huge project. The most mysterious thing about this manor was that no one knew who the owner of this manor was. There were rumors that the owner of this manor was extremely rich and powerful. Some powerful people even said that anyone who was a guest of the manor would be a giant in their industry in the future—and that was the truth. Four years ago, the manor invited four guests over. Soon after that, those four people became people who were great at toadying for personal gains in Riverdale. Some of them were in organizations while some of them were in the business world. For example, the richest man in Riverdale, George Thomas, was one of the guests. The car stopped and Philip got out. He looked at the manor first. It was indeed extravagant. It was built entirely out of white marble. There was a lawn that was about 1,000 square feet. There was a goddess statue on top of the fountain in front of the entrance. The building was modeled after western</p>  <p id = > architecture. Every ten meters of the mansion, there would be a lookout post for bodyguards. The security here was tight. It could be compared to the private mansion of the head of the business world. Philip entered the manor after following a female butler who was about 20 years old. She had an extremely gorgeous body. After Philip entered the place, everyone dismissed themselves quietly. The chandelier inside the brightly-lit hall was custom-made with Swarovski crystals. The sofas and couches were also custom-made. There were golden crown crests at the bottom corner of the furniture. Philip did not sit down. He just stood in the hall and waited. After a while, a middle-aged woman who was elegantly dressed walked down from the crystal spiral stairs. She was wearing low-profile but luxurious branded clothes. Five of her ten fingers were decorated with diamonds and emerald rings. Each and every one of those rings was extremely valuable.</p>  <p id = > This was the true symbol of wealth. “Your father told me that you’re the son he owes the most. So, he entrusted you to inherit all of his fortunes behind my back.” The woman’s name was Giada Wallis. She was the second Madam Clarke. She was also Philip’s stepmother. The head of the Clarkes, Roger Clarke, had six wives. Of course, there could only be one primary wife. Giada was Roger’s second wife. She was also the one with the most power among the Clarkes. After Roger disappeared from the scene, Giada was responsible for half of the Clarke family’s businesses. Giada was a power-hungry and ambitious woman. She was ruthless and extremely schemeful. Giada’s maternal home, the Wallises, was the most powerful and wealthy family in Golden City. There was also a tinge of political blue blood in the family. After Giada married Roger, she took over half of the Clarke family’s businesses very quickly. Giada was not Philip’s biological mother.</p>  <p id = > His mother was the first Madam Clarke. She passed away 13 years ago.</p>  <p id = > Philip was the eldest Clarke and also the son of the first wife. “Aunt Giada, why did you ask me here in the middle of the night? Are you going to talk about inheritance with me?” Philip curled his lips. There was a small smile on his face. “Philip, I know what happened 13 years ago hurt you a lot. Your</p>  <p id = > father has been living in his sins as well. The Clarkes are all in pain. Come back and visit your father with me.” Giada’s tone gave off an icy feeling. It felt like she was keeping her distance. He could not tell what this woman was thinking about. Philip shook his head and said, “I forgot about what happened 13 years ago. Plus, will I get the chance to come back out if I go with you?” Philip’s heart throbbed in pain when he recalled how his mother had died in that fire. He had hired someone to investigate it after. All signs were pointing to this woman in front of him. This woman looked calm on the outside but on the inside, she had an evil heart. “Have you really forgotten about it?” Giada asked. The hall plunged into silence once again.</p>  <p id = > The two of them looked at each other. They were both trying to guess what the other party was thinking about. Philip chuckled and changed the topic.</p>  <p id = > “Aunt Giada, tell me. Why did you ask me here? You’re not a woman who does things without purpose.” It was not the time. He could not fight her yet.</p>  <p id = > Giada smiled and sat on the sofa. She said, “Is this how you view me?”</p>  <p id = > Philip did not answer. However, his cold gaze displayed what he was thinking inside. Giada was an arrogant woman. She was just sitting on the sofa and yet, she looked unapproachable. It was because of her outstanding beauty. Even though she was over 40, she managed to maintain the face of an 18-year-old young woman. “Philip, I hear that you’re married and have a beautiful daughter. Have you forgotten your promise to me?” Giada said suddenly. The smile in her eyes caused Philip to shudder. That promise was also a condition to trap Philip. It was a condition between Philip and Giada.</p>  <p id = > Seven years ago, Philip was forced to leave his family to protect one person.</p>  <p id = > The condition was that no matter if he was alive or dead, he would never expose his true identity to anyone. If not, anyone who knew, no matter who it was, would suffer the cruelest revenge from Giada. Including death. In the eyes of the rich and powerful, death could also be an art form. “Do they know your identity?” Giada asked. Her tone was icy, causing the temperature in the room to fall.</p>  <h2 id =chapter-181 > Chapter 181</h2>  <p id = > “What are you trying to do?” Philip’s face turned cold, and he started feeling anxious. He knew about Giada’s methods. This woman would not hesitate to get rid of her rivals—including her own son. When he was eight, she asked someone to run over him with a car. There was only one reason. It was because she was afraid that he might be the obstacle in her process of taking over the Clarkes. A tiger, though cruel, would not devour its cubs.</p>  <p id = > However, in Giada’s eyes, power was her only priority. When Giada mentioned Philip’s marriage and his daughter, he started to panic. This was also the main reason why Philip had not exposed his identity. “Don’t worry, they’re the daughter-in-law and bloodline of the Clarkes. If you beg me, I’ll let them go.” Giada’s smile would give anyone a bone-piercing chill. It was extremely offensive. “I’m warning you, don’t you dare touch Wynn and Mila. If not, I’ll make you regret this,” Philip said coldly. Giada chuckled calmly. She took out two embroidered boxes from the drawer of the coffee table. They looked delicate. There were also shiny crown crests on the boxes. She smiled and said, “These are for Wynn and Mila. It’s a meeting gift from Aunt Giada.” Philip’s face fell. He did not take the boxes. He just asked coldly, “Giada, I don’t know what you’re planning, but I can tell you confidently that they don’t know who I am. I am also warning you, if you dare to have any ideas toward Wynn and Mila, I won’t mind letting you try my methods! “Also, I’m advising you to go back immediately. Riverdale is not a place where you should be,” Philip said. “I’ll be here for a few days.</p>  <p id = > Don’t worry, I won’t do anything to them yet. But remember, if you want to protect them, you have to be strong enough,” Giada said. Philip was clenching his fists. Then, he unclenched them and said calmly, “Don’t look down on me. I know who you are, Giada Wallis. Ever since you married into this family, I could tell. I already have all kinds of plans to counter your attacks. If you don’t believe me, you can try. This is my last warning for you, if you dare to touch Wynn and Mila, you should plan how you’re going</p>  <p id = > to get out of this.” … Giada stood at the entrance and watched Philip leave.</p>  <p id = > She kept replaying what Philip said to her. That guy had grown up a lot. It turned out that he had known about her true self since he was so young. She wondered how he hid that for so many years. Was this a Clarke? Philip had finally grown his fangs. This lion that had been suppressing all of its anger was finally awakened. Giada smiled and muttered to herself, “This is indeed Roger’s son. He even has his little ways. I underestimated him. I thought he was just a piece of trash who’d endure everything. I didn’t expect him to be ready.” After Philip got back to the hospital, he sat on the hospital bed and looked at Mila who was sound asleep. His eyes were filled with fatherly love. “Mila, Daddy won’t let anyone hurt you,” Philip murmured. The night was like water. It was intertwined with the past of love and hate. Today was Old Master Yates’ 70th birthday party. Early in the morning, Paula asked her daughter Samantha to pick up Martha and her family at the Old Johnston Manor. Martha’s face looked glum, especially when she saw Samantha’s proud look. It was as if her face was covered by a layer of frost. “Aunt Martha, where’s Wynn and Philip? Tell them to hurry up, I’m in a rush.”</p>  <p id = > Samatha was dressed stylishly. She was like a modern woman from television. Her hair was curled, and she was wearing a very expensive outfit.</p>  <p id = > She held the latest Gucci bag in her hand, and there was a pair of sunglasses on her face. She sat on the sofa in the living room rudely. She did not even take off her sunglasses despite being indoors. Samantha looked around this old manor. Her eyes behind her sunglasses were filled with detest. The corner of her lips also curled in disdain. She murmured, “This place smells moldy. Old houses are indeed the worst. I don’t know how a person can live here.” Martha was walking over while holding a bowl of fruits. When she heard Samantha’s murmurs, her face fell. What a b*tch! She was just like her mother! She would ache all over if she did not boast. Judging from her outfit, she wondered how many men Samantha had slept with before scoring her current husband. “Hey, Sammy, why isn’t your mother here?” Martha said with a forced smile on her face. Samantha fanned herself with her hands</p>  <p id = > and answered nonchalantly, “My mom went over on her own. She told me you guys don’t have a car, so she asked me to pick all of you up.” How poor!</p>  <p id = > How could her mother have a sister like this? She was too poor! Did her uncle not make any money in the organization? What a loser! Martha forced out a smile on her lips and faked a laugh. At this moment, Wynn and Philip came home. When they got into the house, Samantha could not wait to grab her bag to walk out of the house. She said bossily, “Why are you only back at this hour? I’ve been waiting for five minutes. This stupid place is so stuffy. It smells like mold too. Let’s go now. My car is outside.” Samantha could not even wait one second more. When she saw Wynn, her face turned cold. Wynn had been better than her in every way since they were young.</p>  <p id = > Her academic results were better, she was prettier, and her job was even better than hers. This made Samantha feel like she was lacking. However, all of that changed when Wynn got married. The proud daughter got married to a spineless coward. In addition to that, her life was getting worse and worse. When Samantha saw Philip who was standing next to Wynn, her eyes were filled with disdain and despise. This man was beyond useless. He was just a stinky stone from the dung hole compared to her husband. What a piece of trash!</p>  <h2 id =chapter-182 > Chapter 182</h2>  <p id = > She was Aunt Paula's only child. She was aloof and looked down on everyone. When they were young, Samantha had been jealous of Wynn. No matter what it was, she had to compare herself to Wynn. \"Cousin, please give us a short while. We'll be ready soon,\" Wynn said apologetically.</p>  <p id = > Samantha raised the corners of her lips with a presumptuous look on her face. She shouted at Philip, \"Get out of the way, useless piece of trash. Why are you standing there?!\" Philip smiled and stepped out of her way in silence. Samantha pushed him abruptly, patted her hands on her clothes in disgust, and muttered, \"You stink.\" After Samantha swaggered away, the entire family was not in the best mood. Martha slammed her hand on the</p>  <p id = > table and started cursing, \"What does Samantha mean?! What a b*tch! She dares come to my house and complain about it! What does she have to show for? Her rich husband? She even said that our house smells musty. I’m so mad!\" Martha’s anger erupted like a volcano. She had anticipated that there would be some mockery from her relatives since she was going back to her family’s home today. Wynn also felt very helpless, but she still comforted her mother and said, \"Mom, keep it to yourself. She did put in the effort to come over to pick us up. Let's try to be more patient when dealing with anything that comes next.\" \"Yeah, Mom, let’s not lower ourselves to their level.\" Philip agreed with a smile. When Martha heard Philip’s words, she immediately redirected her frustration at him and pointed at Philip like she was ready to make a scene. “It’s all because of you. If only you were rich.</p>  <p id = > Look at Paula’s family, their life is so comfortable. They’re driving luxury cars and living in a villa. It’s all because they have a rich son-in-law. If you compare it to our house… Sigh… If you work a little harder, Charles and I would not be looked down on by anyone.” Martha had no intention to stop her abuse toward Phillip. She asked in an unhappy tone, \"What are you doing here? Didn't I ask you not to come?\" Martha suddenly realized that Philip had something in his hand. ‘He wants to go with us?’ That was not okay, definitely not! If Philip went, he would become a laughing stock.</p>  <p id = > \"Mom, why don't you let Philip go? If Philip doesn't get to go, I won't go either,\" Wynn said as she looked at Philip.” Last night, Wynn had made a decision. No matter what, she would have absolute trust in Philip. She was his wife, and she would stand by his side unconditionally. Anger poured over Martha. She pointed at Wynn and screamed at Wynn even though she was out of breath, \"Wynnie, are you trying to kill me?! I will be embarrassed by our family if you bring this wretched bag along with us! Charles, Charles!</p>  <p id = > Come out quickly, Philip wants to come with us!\" When Charles heard the noise outside, he walked out of the study. After he got an understanding of the matter, he said coldly, \"Philip, you don't need to go. Go back to the hospital to accompany Mila.” Philip thought about it for a while and nodded</p>  <p id = > helplessly. \"Okay, as you wish.\" After that, Philip put aside his things and intended to leave. However, Wynn immediately grabbed onto Philip's hand and said righteously, \"No! You must go with me today. If you don't go, I won't go.\" At that moment, Martha was so angry that she sat on the ground and looked like she was about to throw a tantrum. She howled, \"How have things changed! My daughter who I’ve raised for more than 20 years is siding with an outsider to bully her mother! God! Ah, why am I still alive?</p>  <p id = > Just let me die now.\" After she screamed at Wynn, Martha got up and was about to hit her head at the corner of the table. Fortunately, Philip acted quickly and grabbed Martha before her head came into contact with the table. However… Smack! Martha slapped him, then pointed at Philip and said in a vicious tone, \"Go away, get out of my house. I don't have a useless son-in-law like you.\" \"Mom, why did you hit Philip?!\" Wynn was taken aback. She hurriedly pulled Philip closer and shouted at Martha. Then, she looked like she was about to leave with Philip. Martha continued to harass Phillip and threw the small embroidered box that Philip had brought over previously. She scolded, \"You can go by yourself. Your dad and I won't be going!\" Philip picked up the little embroidered box before he was dragged out of the house by an angry Wynn. They got into Samantha's car. \"Philip, are you okay? My mother is just like that. Don't be angry with her. I’ll apologize to you on behalf of her,\" Wynn said distressingly in the car. Philip grinned and rubbed his face. He smiled stupidly and said, \"It's okay.</p>  <p id = > Fortunately, it's still here.\" Wynn looked at the little embroidered box in Philip's hand and rolled her eyes at him. \"You’re still thinking about this? Is this for Grandpa?\" Philip nodded and said, \"I asked someone to buy it a few days ago. Your grandfather will definitely like it.\" Puff! Samantha, who had been browsing for LV bags on her phone, was observing through the rearview mirror. She burst out laughing and said mockingly, \"Philip, what precious gift can this small ugly box hold?” She said that with a disdained tone. After Samantha said that, she threw a few boxes on the passenger seat to them and flaunted. \"Look at what I bought for Grandpa… A small portion</p>  <p id = > of 95-year-old ginseng worth 300,000 dollars, a purple clay pot tea set worth 800,000 dollars, and a jade pipe that is worth more than 400,000 dollars.</p>  <p id = > How much is your little box worth? Around 10 dollars?\"</p>  <h2 id =chapter-183 > Chapter 183</h2>  <p id = > Samantha was so full of herself. When she saw Wynn's long face, she became even more prideful. \"Wynnie, how can you let Philip buy this kind of gift for Grandpa? If you don’t have the money, you can let me know.</p>  <p id = > After all, I’m your cousin.\" With that said, Samantha took out her LV wallet from her Gucci bag, pulled out a bank card, and handed it to Wynn. \"Hey, consider this my treat. There should be at least 10,000 dollars in this card.</p>  <p id = > It’s whatever was left after Frank bought me a handbag. Take it and get something decent for Grandpa. You don’t need to pay me back. This is just a small sum for me.” Samantha’s expression at that moment was full of arrogance. In her eyes, Wynn was a joke. \"Thanks, Samantha.\" Before Wynn could speak, Philip reached out and took the card from Samantha while smiling faintly. Samantha snorted and shook her head helplessly.</p>  <p id = > ‘How can one be so shameless?’ Wynn glared at Philip. She was just about to speak, but Philip held her hand and said with a smile, \"Samantha is being kind, let’s just accept it. I'll just return the money to Samantha later.” Philip did not want things to be uncomfortable between Wynn and Samantha.</p>  <p id = > Wynn kept her mouth shut and acquiesced but her face was burning. She never had a good relationship with Samantha but now that she was taking Samantha’s money, it made her even more ashamed of herself. Samantha chuckled and said, \"Philip, you’re quite thick-skinned.\" After she said that, everyone was silent. Philip held onto Wynn's hand with one hand and played with the embroidered box with the other. What a ridiculous world. ‘I have been ridiculed and looked down on for the longest time. No knows that the embroidered box in my hand is worth more than the accumulated wealth of the entire Yates family.’ After a while, Martha Yates and Charles Johnston came out of the house. They got in the car reluctantly and refused to speak</p>  <p id = > even a single word to Philip. As soon as they got in, Martha began to check out the car. ‘This is indeed a good car, it’s so comfortable to sit in. ‘When we get back, I have to ask Wynn for the contact information of Miss Chloe.</p>  <p id = > Last time, she only handed us the car key, but I still don’t know where the car is.’ Martha had done her research. It was a Maserati, a luxury car worth millions! If she drove out in that car, she would most definitely gain face!</p>  <p id = > If that did not work out, she could just buy a car worth two million. ‘It must be better than this car, and it must deflate Paula’s arrogance!’ Soon enough, the car set off and headed straight to Yates Village. Yates Courtyard was located next to the Eastern Mountain of Yates Village. It was surrounded by mountains and rivers halfway up the mountain. However, it was very suitable for elderly care. This was also the reason why Bob Yates chose to return to Yates Village. Bob Yates, the head of the Yates family, had been living in the Yates Village since he retired. He had been gardening and dallying with his grandchildren. His four children lived up to his expectations—except for his third daughter who married Charles and lived a normal life. The Yates family was one of the major families in Riverdale.</p>  <p id = > They were deeply rooted there, especially Bob Yates who had many students who were now all over the business and political circles. He had a broad network and was very well connected. Therefore, as long as Bob Yates was alive and the Yates family did well, it meant that the Yates family would continue to flourish. At that moment, Bob was in the compound looking at the mountain intersection in the distance. He was waiting for his children to return. Over the years, he had paid little attention to his third daughter. It was mainly because that family brought shame onto the Yates family. Bob was an old-fashioned person. His granddaughter became pregnant before marriage and ended up being married to a wimp. There were gossips about the Yates family in the village and even in Riverdale.</p>  <p id = > Therefore, Bob broke off his relationship with his third daughter out of anger and only saw her once a year. Whenever he thought about how Wynnie, whom he loved since she was a little girl, marrying a good-for-</p>  <p id = > nothing, Bob's face would be covered with frost. He heard from his second daughter, Paula, that the useless piece of trash would also be coming to celebrate his birthday today. In the Yates family, there was a lot of gossip about that wimp, and many people were gearing to see him make a fool of himself.</p>  <h2 id =chapter-184 > Chapter 184</h2>  <p id = > Bob did not bother to put a stop to it at all. After all, he strongly disliked Philip, so he had to teach him a lesson. That piece of trash needed to be made aware that not anyone can step into the door of the Yates family.</p>  <p id = > \"Grandpa, it’s unsure when the others will be arriving. You should get some rest. I'll wait for them here.\" Eric, who was next to Bob, said that and put on a very well-behaved appearance. Usually, Eric had a cold temperament and was arrogant from head to toe. Bob nodded, looked at his little grandson fondly, and walked into the yard with the help of Eric and his walking stick that was made out of black wood inlaid with gold thread. After he sent Bob in, Eric walked out again. At this time, several youngsters stood at the door.</p>  <p id = > They were all the younger generations of the Yates family. \"Eric, what’s the plan?\" A young man, full of arrogance and dressed in expensive clothes, said. He was the youngest son of Peter Yates, the eldest of the Yates family.</p>  <p id = > His name was Aaron Yates. He was the same age as Eric and they had been close since they were young. Therefore, their personalities were similar.</p>  <p id = > They were both rich playboys. Eric smiled coldly and said, \"Let’s inflict all kinds of indignities to that good-for-nothing and humiliate Wynn.\" Aaron nodded in agreement, a gloomy sneer appearing at the corner of his mouth.</p>  <p id = > None of them liked Wynn because Wynn had a different surname. They felt like she excelled in everything that she did when they were growing up, unlike them. Therefore, they intended to put the fear of God in her today.</p>  <p id = > Philip had to go down with her too! The only one who kept her mouth shut was a woman with a cold temperament standing beside them. That was Jess Yates, the second daughter of Peter Yates. She was the same age as Wynn,</p>  <p id = > but she was single. She was annoyed with the tricks of her cousins. She turned around and said coldly, \"I'm heading off.\" \"Cousin, come on. Since we’re here, just enjoy the show.\" Eric winked and smiled at her. Jess'</p>  <p id = > eyebrows tightened. After she thought about it, she stayed on. She decided to lend Wynn a helping hand if it was necessary. After all, she considered Wynn to be her sister. To be honest, when Wynn got married, Jess was there too. She never had any good feelings toward Philip. In her eyes, men were pigs that were not worthy of her. After all, Jess was a high-achieving student. She had obtained a master's degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and was a true female academic tyrant. Therefore, to her, a man would never be as interesting as books. That was why she was still single. At that moment, a black Lincoln Navigator drove into the compound.</p>  <p id = > Philip and Wynn got out of the car first, followed by Martha Yates and Charles Johnston. Wynn panicked when she saw Eric and the others standing at the door. She tugged on Philip's hand slightly and asked in a low voice, \"Philip, are you really okay? Else, you can go back first.” Wynn was very worried that Philip would be humiliated and criticized. Although she was made aware that Philip's family ran the Northern Sky Western Restaurant, in front of the well established Yates family, it was still not enough. There were four children of the second generation of the Yates family. The eldest son, Peter, held a high-level position in the government.</p>  <p id = > He was a man of great power. The second daughter, Paula, married a local entrepreneur in Riverdale whose net worth was around three to four billion dollars. He was in the real estate business and had some connections. The fourth son, Samson, had successfully built his own business empire. He had already expanded his business beyond Riverdale and established branches in eight important cities across the country. The core of his business was overseas trade. He had one billion dollars just in assets. Philip squeezed Wynn's hand and said with a smile, \"Wynnie, believe me. It's going to be okay.\" The Yates family was nothing in Philip's eyes. The Yates family was synonymous with ants when compared to him. If they really dared to</p>  <p id = > provoke him, Philip did not mind letting everyone present today know that he, Philip, was an insurmountable gulf for the Yates family. He was an untouchable taboo! Since the night Giada Wallis came into contact with him, Philip was ready for the day when his true identity would be revealed.</p>  <p id = > Wynn thought for a while and nodded. If things did not work out, she would tell everyone that Philip’s family was actually rich and ran the Northern Sky Western Restaurant. She was hoping that it would impress them. Martha saw that her daughter was still flirting with Philip, so she got angry and snorted a few times. Eric came over with a smile and immediately took a stab at Philip. He sarcastically said, \"Oh, isn’t this my cousin’s good-for-nothing husband? You’re here too, that’s great. It has been a long time. What a rare guest.\" As soon as Philip looked up, he saw Eric's annoying face. It seemed as though Eric could not wait to humiliate him. The Yates family was really broken down from the roots. The cousins around them, as well as the elders who heard the sound and came out to see what the ruckus was about, all cast strange glances. Their expressions ranged from mocking, indifference, and all kinds of eye-rolls. They were looking at Philip as though he was a clown. They thought that Philip would just endure their mockery. Useless bums had no right to speak. However, beyond everyone's expectations, Philip smiled calmly and said, \"Eric, don't look at me with your dog eyes. I don't like being stared at by a flea-infested dog.\"</p>  <h2 id =chapter-185 > Chapter 185</h2>  <p id = > Everyone was dumbfounded with what Philip had just said! Philip, a useless bum, dared to speak to Eric like that? That was unexpected! This good-for-</p>  <p id = > nothing was fighting back! They were in the Yates Courtyard, which was ruled by the Yates family! Did he not consider the consequences of his actions? Eric's face immediately sank. He had an arrogant attitude and said angrily, \"Philip, you dare berate me like that? You are a useless son-in-law of the Johnston family. Who do you think you are to talk to me like this?</p>  <p id = > Who are you to be here today for Grandpa’s birthday celebration? I won't let you pass this door today! Useless piece of sh*t, who do you think you are?!\" Eric was annoyed. He had not expected a good-for-nothing like Philip to berate him like that. It was an insult to him and an insult to the Yates family! Aaron immediately agreed with Eric. He pointed at Philip arrogantly and screamed, \"Hurry up and apologize to Eric. Otherwise, you will not be welcomed in the Yates Courtyard today. Do you hear that, you useless bum?!\" At the gate of the courtyard, many members of the Yates family and relatives of the Yates family were acting as onlookers. When they saw what was going on, they all pointed at Philip, Wynn, and the others to gossip. The strange looks made Wynn feel uncomfortable. Martha was beyond furious.</p>  <p id = > She had already said that they should not bring Philip along. They were screwed. How dare he talk back to Eric. He was obviously trying to pick a fight! \"Look, that's Martha's son-in-law, Philip. He’s a worthless bum. I heard that he’s working as a food deliveryman. He only makes a few thousand dollars a month, and he’s in debt.\" Paula inserted herself into the crowd and started to spew gossip. Her eyes were twitching, and her expression was full of disdain and contempt. What she wanted now was to fan the flames and show everyone how Martha had a ‘good son-in-law’!</p>  <p id = > \"Oh, I've heard of Philip before. He’s completely useless. Didn't someone say that he and Wynn were going through a divorce? Why is he here today?\"</p>  <p id = > \"How dare this good-for-nothing come for the celebration of Bob's birthday.</p>  <p id = > What a wet blanket. I think we should kick him out!\" \"That’s true, Bob doesn’t even like Philip. His presence will just be a stick-in-the-mud.” The group of people kept mocking them, their expressions full of contempt.</p>  <p id = > Martha could not bear the unpleasant comments, so she immediately</p>  <p id = > grabbed Philip and screamed, \"Philip, what are you doing? Why are you being so shameful here?! Leave now and don’t you dare step foot into the doors of the Yates family ever again!\" Martha’s mood was like a barrel of explosives that was triggered by one spark. She thought that her relatives would not let go of the chance to make fun of her, and now that they had started with Philip, how could she just sit still? Charles chose to shut up, but his expression was not the most pleasant. After all, it was Martha's family.</p>  <p id = > The Yates family was as established and solid as a mountain, so he did not dare to speak presumptuously. Besides, before he retired, he had been shielded by the Yates family. He lowered his head and chose not to speak.</p>  <p id = > Wynn tugged on Martha's hand, raised her eyebrows. She said in a displeased tone, \"Mom, this is Eric's fault. Why is he picking on Philip?</p>  <p id = > Philip is your son-in-law, why aren’t you on his side?\" Wynn was also very unhappy. Eric began to hurl insults at Philip immediately after they got out of the car. ‘Does he not have any respect for me, his cousin? Where are his manners? Even my own mother… Why does she have to put the blame on Philip?’ \"Wynn, this is not your place to speak. Stay on the sidelines!\" Fury overcame Martha as she slapped Wynn on the face. She had enough. Wynn had been going against her recently. This time, she was also the one who insisted on bringing Philip over. This whole thing had become a joke. She felt shameful! When he saw Wynn getting slapped, a fresh swell of rage rose in Philip's heart. He placed Wynn behind him, stared at Martha angrily, and said solemnly, \"Martha! Who do you think you are?! In my eyes, you are far less important compared to Wynn! Don’t make a fool of yourself and be a wet blanket!\" Philip was very angry. He had his fists clenched. Wynn, who was behind him, hurriedly grabbed Philip and whispered, \"Philip, don't.\" Only then did Philip unclench his fists and sighed. However, the expression in his eyes was still cold. There were flames blaring in his pupils.</p>  <p id = > If anyone dared to lay their hands on Wynn or humiliate her, Philip would not mind making the biggest fuss that the Yates family had ever seen!</p>  <h2 id =chapter-186 > Chapter 186</h2>  <p id = > Martha also panicked, especially when she saw Philip's furious expression just now. ‘What’s with this wimp’s change of attitude recently? He even dared to talk back to me a couple of times.’ Eric was beyond joyful. He had not fully pulled out his bag of tricks and the Johnston family already started fighting among themselves. It seemed that Martha really disliked Philip. He could take advantage of this. Martha glared at Philip, pulled Charles, and went into the compound. Samantha was long gone. She was by Paula's side.</p>  <p id = > Her eyebrows were twitching as she observed this slapstick coldly. ‘Wynn, oh Wynn, you have such a sad life. You married a good-for-nothing.’</p>  <p id = > Samantha muttered a few words in her heart and was about to turn around and go in. However, when Wynn led Philip to enter, Eric stopped them again. \"Wynn, as I said just now, Philip is not worthy of entering the door of the Yates family!\" Eric's nostrils were tilted upward. He looked very arrogant. In his eyes, Philip was trash, and the Yates family did not welcome such a useless bum. Aaron also stood at the door to block them. Wynn frowned, her face quickly becoming chilly. She said, \"Eric, Aaron, I am your cousin. Give way to me!\" Wynn was really angry. She did not expect Eric and Aaron to act as such. They had absolutely no respect for her. However, Eric and Aaron did not budge at all. They stared at Philip provocatively and said, \"Philip, if you don't want Wynn to be kicked out of the Yates family, leave by yourself now. No one here welcomes you.\" The corners of Philip's mouth curled up as he displayed an indifferent smile. Jess, who had been watching by the side, walked over and pushed Eric and Aaron out of the way. She said coldly, \"What are you two doing? Aren't you afraid that Grandfather will scold you? The celebration is about to begin. Are you trying to make the whole Yates family know that this is how we treat the granddaughter and grandson-in-law?\" Eric and Aaron frowned, glanced at Jess, then stared at Philip angrily. They smiled threateningly and said,</p>  <p id = > \"Philip, we’ll wait and see. There will be a good show coming up in a while.</p>  <p id = > I hope you don't run away halfway through it.\" After that, the two turned around and went in. Wynn said gratefully, \"Jess, thank you.\" Jess glanced at Wynn indifferently, especially after holding her gaze on Philip for a few more seconds. She said coldly, \"Philip, if you don’t want Wynn to lose face, I advise you to go in and greet everyone. Leave after that.\" After that, Jess turned around and flicked her hair. Philip was startled. He wanted to say a few words to thank her, but he did not expect that he was still looked down on by her. He and Wynn looked at each other. The latter said worriedly,</p>  <p id = > \"Philip, are you really okay? I… I'm worried...\" Philip shook his head and said with a smile, \"Don't worry, Wynnie. It's okay, trust me.\" After that, the two of them entered the Yates Courtyard. In the Yates Courtyard, rows and rows of banquet tables had already been set up. Of course, it was divided into a distinct pecking order. The highest order was in the inner hall. The people there would be sitting with Bob Yates. The main seat was still empty as Bob Yates had not come yet. The inner hall could only be entered by Bob Yates’ children and those so-called Yates family connections. Then, there was the nave below the inner hall. There were four tables set up, all of which were for the relatives of Bob Yates to celebrate his birthday. The lowest class was naturally the outer hall, where six tables were set up. They were people present for the sole purpose of having dinner. \"Wow, check that out.</p>  <p id = > It's Ted Yates, Peter Yates' eldest son!\" Everyone saw a handsome young man stepping into the courtyard and walking into the inner hall. At that time, even the elders and big shots who were already seated in the inner hall focused their attention on the young man! \"Ted Yates of the Yates family, the most outstanding junior in the Yates family!\" In the entire courtyard, many people had their attention on Ted. Philip's brows were also slightly furrowed. The Yates family could be regarded as a powerful family in Riverdale, especially Bob Yates who had a lot of connections. Ted Yates, as the eldest son of Peter Yates and the eldest son of the Yates family, naturally received a lot of attention and love. Ted Yates did not let everyone down either. He started his own company at a young age and successfully</p>  <p id = > went public. Now, he was worth two to three billion dollars! It could be said that Bob Yates liked Ted very much, and he even planned to train Ted to be the third-generation successor. After Eric and Aaron saw Ted step into the inner hall, their faces were dark and cold. They drank their cup of tea angrily. They were at odds with Ted, and the Yates family members knew it. Eric felt uncomfortable. He noticed Philip who was sitting by the door in the outer courtyard. He had a plan in his heart and walked over with Aaron.</p>  <h2 id =chapter-187 > Chapter 187</h2>  <p id = > Philip sat next to Wynn and naturally noticed Eric and Aaron walking over.</p>  <p id = > They had a devious smile on their faces. “Philip, why are you sitting in the outer courtyard near the door? This is where I used to feed my dog.” Eric looked at Philip and smirked coldly. There was a glint of sarcasm in his eyes. Wynn’s face went red. She wanted to stand up but a huge hand stopped her. Philip smiled calmly. “The outer courtyard and the hall are the same. It depends on who’s the one sitting at which location to eat. Plus, the hall belongs to the Yates. I don’t care for it.” Philip had been holding in for so long. He did not mind being arrogant for a bit. Most importantly, Eric was too hateful. He just had to create something out of nothing. “Hehe, you’re really something else. You even know how to brag. You’re just a piece of trash. We’re doing charity by letting you eat on a table in the house with the rest of the Yates. Do you understand, you worthless wretch?!” Eric scoffed.</p>  <p id = > Jess frowned. Initially, Jess could have sat in the hall but in order to take care of Wynn, she decided to sit in the outer courtyard. “That’s enough, Eric. Can’t you just shut up? Do you have to argue with Philip?” Jess frowned and said. Despite her detesting Philip, she was still Wynn’s cousin.</p>  <p id = > She would help her as best as she could. Eric’s face fell as he looked at Jess.</p>  <p id = > He did not dare to do anything to her. After all, she was the second daughter of his eldest uncle. She was also a top student. Plus, a lot of great and good people had approached her to ask for her hand in marriage. Jess had a bright future ahead of her. “Hehe, Philip, are you planning to hide behind my sister</p>  <p id = > like a spineless coward the entire day?” Eric jeered. “Eric, do you really despise me that much?” Philip could not help but snort. “If it wasn’t for Wynn, I wouldn’t have even come. Let me give you some advice, don’t provoke me and don’t provoke Wynn. If not, I’ll make you kneel on the ground and beg me for mercy.” “What? What did you say? Me kneeling and begging you for mercy? Were you dropped on your head when you were born? How dare you say something like that!” Eric guffawed. There was detest in his eyes. Philip was so shameless. He even had the guts to say something like this. He wondered who gave him the courage to do so.</p>  <p id = > “That’s enough. You need to stop this. And you should shut your mouth too!” Jess was mad. She glared at Eric and looked at Philip angrily. This guy knew that Eric was trying to humiliate him and he was still talking back to him. ‘You’re just a spineless in-law of the Yates. Can’t you just sit here and eat properly? Can’t you just leave after you’re done? ‘You just have to make a fool out of yourself, huh?’ With that, Jess started to look at Philip in anger. She even started to regret sitting here. “Philip is so arrogant. How dare he say something so shameless.” “Right? I didn’t expect him to not only be a piece of trash but also a piece of trash who loves to brag.” “Hehe, I don’t want to sit at the same table with him anymore. Let’s go to another table.” The other villagers from the Yates Village who came here to attend the party started to look at Philip as if he was a clown. They started to get up one by one to go to another table. In an instant, the only people at this table were Philip, Wynn, and Jess. Eric was pleased. He jeered loudly,</p>  <p id = > “Philip, don’t say I’m mistreating you. A piece of trash like you has no right sitting and eating here. If you know your place, you should get out of here.</p>  <p id = > Do you hear me?” ‘How dare he spew nonsense about making me kneel and beg? ‘Does he think he’s Ted? ‘Ted has his own company and his own resources. Everyone will believe anything he says. ‘How dare a good-for-nothing like Philip act so arrogant? ‘You’re looking down on the Yates! If the old master knows about this, he’ll definitely kick you out in front of everybody!’ When he thought about this, Eric eyed at Aaron. The latter</p>  <p id = > understood immediately. He walked away silently and ran into the drawing room inside the hall. At this moment, Bob was chatting with his children and a few of his close friends. When he got in, Aaron made an angry face and yelled, “Grandpa, you have to see this! Philip was so rude! He’s looking down on the Yates and even wanted to hit Eric!” After he said that, everyone in the drawing room started to make noise. Paula was thrilled. She wanted so badly to run out and watch what was going on. ‘It’ll be amazing if they started fighting. ‘In that case, that spineless coward will be kicked out and Martha will be completely humiliated!’ Samson and Peter were indifferent.</p>  <p id = > They did not have the right to speak since their father was here. On the other hand, Martha had every intention to kill Philip right now. Philip could not even stay still for one minute! If they really started fighting, Martha would get kicked out of the Yates family forever! Old Master Yates took his cane made out of black wood and inlaid with gold thread to slam down on the tiles on the floor angrily. His face fell as he said, “How dare he!” In a blink of an eye, the temperature in the drawing room plummeted. Everyone knew that the old master was mad. Martha was incredibly nervous. She started sweating, and even her legs were now trembling. After he said that, Old Master Yates got out of the drawing room with Aaron supporting him. Then, they walked out to the outer courtyard where the party was. The crowd followed closely behind Old Master Yates and got out one by one. At the outer courtyard, Eric was arguing with Philip loudly. They were even engaged in a fistfight. Philip was livid. Eric had splashed some alcohol on Wynn and called her a b*tch! He was digging his own grave! Philip grabbed Eric’s collar. There was a layer of frost on Philip’s face. He lifted his fist and was about to punch down on Eric’s bruised face when suddenly... “Stop it!” A roar sounded in the hall.</p>  <h2 id =chapter-188 > Chapter 188</h2>  <p id = > Everyone looked over in the direction of the voice. Old Master Yates was staring at Philip. His face was icy. Anger rose from his body as he yelled,</p>  <p id = > “Get out of the Yates Manor if you dare to hit him!” At this moment, the outer courtyard was filled with people. They did not try to help. They did not even tell them to stop. They were just standing at one side while watching what was going on. When they saw Old Master Yates, everyone stood at one side in fear. They all lowered their heads silently. He was the head of the Yates. Who would dare to provoke him? If they offended Old Master Yates, they should just get out of Riverdale. Philip was done for!</p>  <p id = > Under everyone’s respectful gazes, Old Master Yates approached the two men while his cane clacked on the floor loudly. He was radiating with anger.</p>  <p id = > He lifted his cane and swung it at Philip’s hand that was raised mid-air.</p>  <p id = > Smack! Philip was in pain. His entire right arm was numb. “You unbridled piece of trash! How dare you hit Eric! Is this your amazing son-in-law, Martha?” Old Master Yates glared at Martha who was standing behind him and shouted. Martha was shaking all over from fear. She did not look at the old master directly. No one would be able to handle the old master when he was mad. She wanted so badly to chop Philip into pieces right now. This was so embarrassing! Wynn stood up hurriedly and pulled Philip to one side.</p>  <p id = > When she saw that he was in pain, the tears in her eyes started rolling down her cheeks uncontrollably. After Old Master Yates scolded Martha, he turned around and glared at Philip. He roared, “Philip, so you’re really looking down on the Yates, huh? How dare you start a fight at my party! Do you have any ounce of respect for me?” Bob was livid. How dare this piece of trash start a fight during his birthday celebration! Who did he think he was? What right did he have to start a fight? Philip’s mouth was gaping from the pain. He swung his arm and said coldly, “Old Master Yates, I’m here to celebrate your birthday with you. However, Eric kept provoking me to no end. He even insulted Wynn. You didn’t even ask what was going on and immediately pushed all the blame on me. Aren’t you a little biased? Is Wynn not your granddaughter?” Bob was taken aback. He looked at Wynn who was standing next to Philip. She was covered in alcohol and her eyes were red. Then, he looked at Eric behind him. He had a devious smirk on his face.</p>  <p id = > After he noticed the old master looking at him, he lowered his head and pretended to be a good boy. However, could he scold Eric in front of so many people? Of course not! Martha was his daughter who was married into another family. A daughter who has married her husband was equivalent to water that had been splashed. Thus, it cannot be retrieved anymore. Wynn was not a Yates. She was his granddaughter with another last name. Bob snorted. “Scatter!” It ended with no conclusion. Philip had even suffered a beating. His entire right arm was still numb even after sitting down. Eric was looking at him provokingly at one side. He gave him the finger. Wynn sat next to Philip and massaged his arm for him. Tears rolled down her cheek like a string of broken pearls. She felt extremely wronged. “It’s fine, Wynnie. Don’t cry,” Philip said while feeling hurt. Wynn was still sobbing.</p>  <p id = > She glared at Philip angrily and said, “Can’t you just endure this?” Philip smiled toothily and said, “I can endure it if Eric insulted me, but I can’t let him bully you. The Yates is just a small family. They mean nothing to me.</p>  <p id = > If they continue to go overboard, I don’t mind wiping them out from this world.” Wynn glared at him and pinched the flesh between his waist. “Stop boasting. Your mom and dad only run restaurants. My grandpa is powerful.</p>  <p id = > Moreover, the Yates is not a small family.” Philip touched his nose and did not say anything. “Cough, cough!” Jess walked over and coughed a few times. She walked over with some Yunnan Baiyao and looked at Philip coldly. “Can’t you just sit here properly? Do you have to make everyone mad? You deserved to be hit!” Jess overheard the first part of what Philip and Wynn had said. What did he mean by a small family? He even wanted to make the Yates disappear? This guy was so good at boasting! Did this f*ckboy lie to Wynn that way to get her too? She had to find a chance to talk to Wynn. Philip took the medicine and grinned. “Thank you, Jess.” Jess ignored him. She took out a book from somewhere and sat down. Then, she started reading it. The book was about Buffer’s past interviews. He was the most successful investor in the world! He was worth hundreds of billions!</p>  <p id = > He was the person that everyone looked up to! However, in Philip’s opinion,</p>  <p id = > Buffer was just merely his financial manager. Philip pondered for a while and had an idea. He decided to find an opportunity to invite Buffer to have a meeting with Jess. It would be his way of thanking Jess for helping them twice. “Um, Jess, do you want to meet Buffer?” Philip asked suddenly with a grin on his face.</p>  <h2 id =chapter-189 > Chapter 189</h2>  <p id = > Buffer? Jess looked at Philip in confusion. There was no hint of tomfoolery on his face. What did he mean? Did he know who Buffer was? He was the god of investment! He had hundreds of billions worth of assets and was among the top in Forbes’ list of billionaires in the world! A person like him was looked up to by so many people. Could she meet him just like that?</p>  <p id = > “Philip, you’re getting used to talking big, huh?” Hence, Jess thought that Philip was joking. She rolled her eyes at him and proceeded to ignore him.</p>  <p id = > If Philip knew what Jess was thinking about right now, he would be laughing his head off. Was Buffy so great? He only had that amount of assets because Philip asked him to keep them for him. He shook his head helplessly and let out a bitter laugh. Then, Philip walked out of the courtyard and came to a more secluded place. He took out his phone and found Buffer’s number after a long while. After that, he gave him a call. In a flash, a respectful yet excited voice sounded from the other end of the phone. His voice was hoarse due to age, and he said with broken English, “Dear Young Master Philip, is that you? I’ve been waiting for so long for your call. I didn’t think the honorable Young Master Philip would remember me.” Then, a sob sounded. Philip felt awkward and said hurriedly, “Buffy, where are you making money now?”</p>  <p id = > “Please don’t make fun of me, Young Master Philip. I’ve invested your assets in different industries all over the world. For now, they’re worth 130</p>  <p id = > billion in total. Are you coming here to take a look?” At this moment, Buffer was in a luxurious European-style manor. While on the phone with Philip, his usual temperament changed. Even the ten or so maids surrounding him looked surprised. There were not a lot of people in the world who Mr. Buffer</p>  <p id = > respected. His blonde female secretary had a pair of blue eyes and a smoking hot body. Even she was shocked when she saw that. “It’s fine, I’m just calling to tell you something. Come to my place when you’re free. I have a friend who wants to meet you,” Philip said flatly. “Young Master Philip, I’ll definitely fulfill your wishes. I’ll fly over tomorrow. Tell your friend to wait for me,” Buffer said excitedly. Philip said immediately, “Not too soon. Wait a while before you make your trip here. Alright, I have something to take care of. I’ll hang up now.” Buffer was still so kind. “Young Master Philip, do you have anything else I can help you with?” Buffer wanted so badly to be of some assistance to Philip. This was the person who gave him his assets.</p>  <p id = > Without Philip, there would be no Buffer. “No need. I’m at my wife’s grandfather’s birthday party,” Philip said and hung up the phone. After a while, Buffer paced back and forth in his huge and glorious meeting room.</p>  <p id = > “Alice, book a plane ticket to Orienta for me. I’m going to fly there tomorrow. Plus, help me find out who’s Mr. Clarke’s wife’s grandfather. If he has any properties, we’ll invest in them,” Buffer said excitedly. “We’ll invest one billion!” The sexy secretary replied, “Alright, Boss. I’ll do it right away.” After she said that, she turned around and left. Back to Philip. He did not know Buffer had misunderstood his phone call. Half an hour later, the Yates’ property was funded with one billion from a huge financial group.</p>  <p id = > As for now, the Yates had no idea. Philip went back to the party and sat down next to Wynn. “Where did you go?” asked Wynn. “Toilet,” replied Philip. At the party, Bob Yates was talking to his children and best friends.</p>  <p id = > They were having a lot of fun. Everyone was going up to congratulate Old Master Yates. “I wish you a happy birthday and many more of them. Also, may your happiness be as immense as the East Sea!” Eric put his hands together and congratulated the old master. Then, he gave him his present and said while feeling pleased with himself, “Grandpa, I saw this at the jade market. It’s top-grade jadeite and I crafted it into a Black Tortoise for you.”</p>  <p id = > Bob was smiling widely. He patted Eric on the shoulder and said, “Okay, my wonderful grandson. Here, this is from me to you.” After he said that,</p>  <p id = > Bob took out a red packet for Eric. There was a card in the red packet that had one million bucks inside. Eric took it happily. He had only spent 100,000 bucks on the jade Black Tortoise. He made a profit this time. Philip saw this and scoffed inside his heart. He murmured, “Black Tortoise? Isn’t that just a thousand-year-old tortoise?” Wynn kicked Philip under the table.</p>  <p id = > She rolled her eyes at him. “Stop talking nonsense.” Philip shrugged and had a nonchalant look on his face. He was not interested in all of the Yates right now. He could only smell a foul stench coming from all of them. Jess’</p>  <p id = > hearing was good, so naturally, she heard what was being said. She glared at Philip, her impression of him getting worse. Not only did this guy like to boast, but he was rude no matter which occasion it was. Then, Aaron was next. He gave the old master calligraphy. “Grandpa, this is the genuine inscription from the master of Chinese national culture, Kendrick Smalls.</p>  <p id = > Look at these three words. ‘Auspicious and Wealth’.” Old Master Yates was ecstatic. He kept praising Aaron. In only a few minutes, Aaron was able to present himself to the crowd. He was feeling proud of himself. On the other hand, Eric’s face fell slightly. Aaron also received a red packet. He stood at one side happily. The eldest child, Peter, nodded slightly. His useless son had finally won against his youngest brother’s child for once. Samson clenched his fist secretly. He only had one son. His son became ignorant and incompetent because he spoiled him too much. It looked like he needed to lecture him properly when they got back. If not, Eric risked losing all of his assets.</p>  <h2 id =chapter-190 > Chapter 190</h2>  <p id = > Jess got up when it was her turn. She looked at Wynn and Philip before sighing. “Grandpa, this is the acceptance letter from Harvard. I’m going for my Ph.D.” Jess took out an acceptance letter. This was the top student’s gifting method. She was so f*cking low-profile! Harvard! The best educational establishment! Bob was so happy that his eyes turned into two lines. He took over the letter and started praising repeatedly, “Splendid! My</p>  <p id = > eldest son’s daughter never disappoints me. There’s going to be a superwoman among the Yates!” Hahaha! Everyone started to compliment Jess. Bob gave her a red packet which she accepted as well. Then, under the expecting gazes of everyone, Ted got up after having been sitting the entire time. He walked empty-handed in front of the old master and said calmly,</p>  <p id = > “Grandpa, I was in a rush when I came here, so I didn’t bring anything.”</p>  <p id = > Everyone was shocked after they heard that. Did not bring anything? This was not something Ted would do. Peter was sitting there calmly, even taking a sip of his tea. He looked indifferent. It was as if he had predicted this.</p>  <p id = > When Eric and Aaron heard this, they jumped out impatiently. They accused, “Ted, this is such an important party and you didn’t even prepare a gift?! Do you not respect Grandpa?” Provocation. Ted lifted his eyebrow.</p>  <p id = > His calm, dark eyes were glimmering while he looked at the two idiots. Bob smiled and said, “It’s fine. Teddy is busy with work. It’s fine that he forgot.”</p>  <p id = > This was Bob’s love for Ted. The crowd did not dare to say anything more.</p>  <p id = > However, in the next second, Ted said calmly, “Grandpa, I’ve taken the oasis development project at the south of Riverdale.” Everyone in the hall immediately shifted their gaze over to Ted after he said that. This child was amazing! This present was magnificent! It stabilized the crowd immediately. The Oasis development project in the south of Riverdale was a 300 million project! If the Yates got it, the profit in the future would be at least 500 million! Which meant that Ted alone could make 500 million for the Yates! He was terrifying! Peter finally displayed a small smile on his face. He had been calm and confident the entire time. Bob stood up excitedly. He looked at Ted with his eyes wide open and asked, “Really?”</p>  <p id = > Ted nodded and answered, “Yes.” “Wonderful! Wonderful! Wonderful!”</p>  <p id = > He repeated the word ‘wonderful’ three times. This perfectly showed Bob’s excitement. “You’re indeed the grandson I feel the most optimistic about!</p>  <p id = > There’s hope for the Yates grandchildren! There’s so much hope!” Bob nodded and praised continuously. He turned around to look at Peter and said,</p>  <p id = > “Peter, you can just leave the family business to Teddy if you want to. I’ll</p>  <p id = > be at ease with him around.” Everyone let out a gasp of surprise. He was handing over his power. Old Master Yates had decided to train Ted as the heir! Peter answered, “Of course, Dad.” Ted sat back down next to Peter.</p>  <p id = > Then, the latter told him, “Well done. You can come to me with any questions. I’ll help you with the procedure.” Ted nodded. The hall became more lively now. The people who attended the party lifted their glasses to congratulate Old Master Yates. They were congratulating him for taking the Oasis development project in the south of Riverdale. Now, the Yates’</p>  <p id = > position in Riverdale would go up one rank! The youngest son, Samson, was the only one feeling blue. He glared at Eric angrily. What an incompetent fool! Eric knew his father was unhappy with him. He shifted his gaze and noticed Wynn and Philip at the outer courtyard. They were chatting and laughing together. At that moment, he got up and jeered sarcastically.</p>  <p id = > “Wynn, why haven’t you come and congratulate Grandpa? What present did you bring? Why don’t you show us?” After he said that, everyone shifted their gaze to the table at the outer courtyard. They were looking over there with weird looks in their eyes. Their gazes were complicated. There was mockery, contempt, despise, and wrath in their gazes. Of course, the wrath came from Martha. Damn it! She knew she was going to be humiliated.</p>  <p id = > Wynn was nervous. She looked at Philip and the latter took out an embroidered box from his pocket. He passed it to Wynn and said, “It’s fine.</p>  <p id = > Take this over.” “Really?” Wynn took over the box. She was curious but at the same time, extremely nervous. If they made a fool out of themselves right now, they would be utterly humiliated. ‘It’s fine. I’ll just take Philip home after we eat.’ Then, Wynn took Philip’s box under everyone’s malicious gaze and got up. She walked slowly to the hall.</p>  <h2 id =chapter-191 > Chapter 191</h2>  <p id = > Everyone at the birthday party was looking at Wynn with contempt and disdain in their eyes. Eric and Aaron’s gifts that were presented moments before were extremely valuable. Then, Ted announced the shocking news</p>  <p id = > of attaining the Oasis development project at the south of Riverdale. He would be making 500 million for the Yates! Now, it was Wynn’s turn. What gift would her family be presenting today? Martha sat on her seat, extremely nervous. She saw what Wynn was holding. It was the box that Philip had previously given to her. If Wynn gave that thing to her father, it would be the biggest joke of the century. Everyone would look at them as if they were fools! Eric stared at Wynn with mockery on his face. He looked at the small box in her hands and the smirk on his face got wider. He lifted his eyebrow and said, “Cousin, it’s Grandpa’s 70th birthday today. Are you really going to give this tiny box to him? What valuable item can it hold?” Eric snorted in his head. He saw with his own two eyes that this thing had been given to Wynn by that good-for-nothing Philip. He was penniless and powerless.</p>  <p id = > What kind of gift could he afford? When he thought about this, his smirk grew wider. He was waiting to watch Wynn and Philip make fools of themselves. Aaron stood at one side and chimed in sarcastically, “Cousin, even if you don’t have the money, you should at least bring some presentable gifts. This tiny thing is going to bring so much shame to Aunt Martha. All of the Yates present are powerful and prestigious. Plus, Grandpa’s friends are also here. Isn’t your gift a little too plain?” It was obvious he wanted to humiliate Wynn. “That’s enough. Stop this, you two.”</p>  <p id = > Jess could not watch this anymore. She glared at the two of them angrily.</p>  <p id = > Eric and Aaron chose to ignore her. The loathing on their expressions did not diminish one bit. Even Ted who was sitting in the hall looked slightly helpless when he lifted his head and saw Wynn walking in. He used to be close with Wynn when they were kids. However, the older they got, the more they distanced themselves from each other. After all, she was not one of the Yates. There might not be any relations between them anymore. This was the nature of human relationships. Under everyone’s gaze, Wynn walked into the hall and handed the box to Bob. His face was cold when Wynn said, “Grandpa, this is from me and Philip.” Wynn believed Philip.</p>  <p id = > He would not give the old master a plain gift at such an important occasion.</p>  <p id = > However, she did not think that it would be something very valuable. After all, Philip had run away from home. He would not have much money. Bob nodded and grunted a reply. He did not even take the box. Wynn felt awkward. Everyone at the table was looking at her with weird expressions.</p>  <p id = > Wynn felt extremely uncomfortable. She put the box down and turned around to walk away. Bob did not give her a red packet. He was obviously favoring the rest of his grandchildren while discriminating against her.</p>  <p id = > However, when Wynn was about to leave, Eric snatched the box and announced loudly to everyone in the hall, the center court, and outer courtyard, “Oh? I thought it was something valuable. Looks like it’s an ornamental thumb ring! It’s also made from jade!” His words were laced with provocation. When people saw Eric taking out the jade ornamental thumb ring and putting it onto his thumb, they laughed alongside. Aaron also chimed in, “What jade? Can our dear cousin afford this? I think it’s fake. Did you hear what she said just now? She said she bought this with Philip.” “Oh? Right!” Eric pretended to realize this. Then, he took the jade ornamental thumb ring and yelled at Philip who was sitting at the table nearest to the door at the outer courtyard, “Philip! Where did you find this?</p>  <p id = > It looks so old. Did you pick this up from the dumpster and give it to my grandpa?” That was such a devastating criticism. Some people looked over at Philip with detest in their eyes. It was clear that Eric and Aaron did not plan to stop bothering Philip. Philip ignored them. He only drank his tea calmly and ate some of the food. These idiots did not even know what that was. If they knew the true value of that jade ornamental thumb ring, would they kneel on the ground and address him as a lord? When Eric saw that Philip did not want to pay attention to him, he lost interest in provoking him.</p>  <p id = > Then, he stuffed the ring back into the box and threw the box to one side as if it was trash. Bob only peered at it coldly and did not say anything. To be honest, the one thing that made him happiest today was Ted taking the Oasis development project at the south of Riverdale. It was a thing worth celebrating for the Yates. Sure enough, Peter stood up and held his glass.</p>  <p id = > He said, “Dad, we have three simultaneous happy events in the family today.</p>  <p id = > I wish you a long and happy life!” Bob could not close his mouth from smiling. He grabbed his cane with one hand and his glass with the other. He said, “Alright, I’ll drink to that.” The party started and everyone began to socialize with each other. They were enjoying themselves tremendously.</p>  <p id = > Wynn went back to Philip and started to space out while sitting next to him.</p>  <p id = > She saw through the Yates today. They were horrible. She did not like that these people were paying lip service the entire time. If possible, she did not want to attend any more family gatherings. Philip sent a message to George.</p>  <p id = > ‘Old Man George, help me investigate Bob Yates.’ After a few seconds, Philip got a reply. ‘Young Master, Bob Yates has retired. He used to manage the properties of the Yates and over half of his collaborations were related to the Clarkes. The eldest son, Peter Yates, has some power for the moment, but just one word from you and he’ll be gone. You invested in the youngest son, Samson Yates’ company, so you have 70% of the equity shares. Peter’s eldest son, Ted Yates, took the Oasis development project at the south of Riverdale recently, and I was the one who gave him…” ‘F*ck me!’ Philip did not expect that most of the Yates’ projects and enterprises were all related to him. This… This was awkward.</p>  <h2 id =chapter-192 > Chapter 192</h2>  <p id = > ‘Wait for my signal. I don’t like the Yates.’ Philip replied to the message in secret and put away his phone. George was over at the chairman’s office in Apex Group. After he got the message, he lifted his eyebrow and asked his secretary to announce this. As long as Philip opened his mouth, he would make sure to bankrupt the Yates. These blind fools must have crossed the young master. “Philip, what are you doing?” Wynn noticed Philip had been playing with his phone the entire time, which is why she asked curiously.</p>  <p id = > “Oh, it’s nothing. Professor Turner told me he’ll arrange Mila’s surgery for next Wednesday,” Philip replied. “Really?” Wynn was excited. She grabbed onto Philip’s hand emotionally. Mila was her everything. Which mother</p>  <p id = > would want to see their own child suffer? “Yeah.” Philip patted the back of Wynn’s hand lovingly. “Hey, did you hear that the Oasis development project in the south of Riverdale was developed by the richest man in Riverdale, George Thomas? Ted’s making all of us proud by taking that project!” “Right? I heard that the boss behind this project is a world-class nouveau riche. He’s f*cking loaded!” “Ted’s future is going to be so bright.</p>  <p id = > It’s obvious that Bob wants to train him as the heir of the third generation.</p>  <p id = > We have to curry more favors with him.” The group started chattering excitedly. Their conversation was starting to get heated. They wanted to be Ted Yates so badly. “Hey, what’s wrong with that useless bum? I heard that the Yates don’t like him that much.” Suddenly, someone shifted the conversation to Philip. “You don’t know? Bob’s granddaughter, which is Wynn over there, got pregnant before marriage and the child belongs to that spineless coward. You should know that this is something extremely shameful in the Yates Village. She ruined the family name and isn’t chaste at all!” “No wonder! So from what you said, Wynn is not a good woman too. Is she a… you know? She’s so shameless for getting pregnant before getting married.” In a flash, everyone started looking over. Philip frowned from their gazes. These people were so slanderous. Especially those middle-aged women over there. Their verbal abuse would make anyone feel agitated! Wynn lowered her head even more. Three years ago, she became the shame of the family because of this matter. Everyone started pointing fingers at her. Today, these people were digging out the past again. They were stabbing her in the heart with knives. Philip’s face fell as he squeezed Wynn’s hand. Then, he got up and walked over to the middle-aged women who were gossiping. He carried a chair over and sat down. He chuckled and said, “Aunties, do you know what kind of people will die the most horrible deaths?” When the middle-aged women saw Philip sitting at their table, they felt a little guilty. However, they were not scared. They rolled their eyes and shook their heads. Then, they raised their eyebrows and looked at him in contempt. They had already seen everything just now. Philip was just a</p>  <p id = > good-for-nothing. “You’re just a piece of trash. What right do you have to sit here and talk to us?” One of the women snorted. Smash! Philip took a wine bottle and smashed it on the ground before yelling angrily, “Do you not f*cking know what's good for you?! If not for the fact that you’re my seniors, would you believe that I’ll slap each and every one of you? “You can put anything in your mouth but don’t you dare spout rubbish. Watch your mouths. If not, don’t blame me for not going easy on you! Nosy b*tches!” Philip’s face was cold, but flames were burning in his eyes. All of the middle-aged women on the table were horrified by Philip’s imposing manner. They shut their mouths while feeling guilty. They did not dare to say anything more. However, when he turned his back to them, they started cursing Philip and Wynn furiously. They wanted so badly to beat them up.</p>  <p id = > Philip went back to his seat. Wynn rolled her eyes at Philip and said, “Why did you go against them? They know nothing.” Philip smiled lazily and said,</p>  <p id = > “They were spouting rubbish. They need to be taught a lesson. You’re Philip Clarke’s wife. I’ll rip out the mouths of whoever dares to bully you.”</p>  <p id = > Wynn’s heart was warm and fuzzy when she heard Philip saying that, despite it not being something pleasant to hear. Jess was sitting on the other side. She glanced over at Philip. It seemed that this man adored his wife very much. He was not that bad. Back to the main hall. At this moment, everyone was talking about the Oasis development project heatedly.</p>  <p id = > Naturally, Ted became the center of everyone’s attention. Bob was greedy, so he had drunk a bit too much. At the same time, a middle-aged man ran into the main hall from the outer courtyard. His face was excited and frantic.</p>  <p id = > “O-Old master! Something big happened!” The middle-aged man was Bob’s secretary. He was responsible for all the external affairs of the Yates’</p>  <p id = > businesses. He was the one who made announcements if anything happened.</p>  <p id = > Bob frowned and said unhappily, “Why are you being so frantic?” The middle-aged man did not even wipe away his sweat before saying, “One…</p>  <p id = > One billion! The company just got an investment of one billion bucks!”</p>  <p id = > Suddenly! The room fell silent. No one could believe their ears. An investment of one billion bucks?</p>  <h2 id =chapter-193 > Chapter 193</h2>  <p id = > An investment of one billion bucks! All of the Yates’ assets were just worth 700 to 800 million bucks! Adding in Bob’s own company with Samson and Ted’s company, they only had a little over a billion! This investment of one billion bucks came out of nowhere! How would he not be excited? Bob stood up excitedly and widened his eyes. He asked while gasping for air,</p>  <p id = > “What… What did you say? Say it again!” “Old Master, we got an investment of one billion dollars!” the middle-aged man finally wiped his sweat and said with the same excitement. In an instant, Bob’s face turned red. He lifted his head and guffawed at the sky. “Wonderful! The Yates family is finally going to enter high society! An investment of one billion dollars! Go and find out who was the one who invested in us. We have to invite them here and take good care of them!” This person must be an extremely rich billionaire. He had to treat him with respect. Bob was ready to invite them here himself. The middle-aged man replied, “It’s an angel investor. He goes by the name of Mr. Clarke. Old Master, do you know anyone with Clarke as his last name?” The middle-aged man was puzzled.</p>  <p id = > He had stayed with Bob for more than ten years. He knew most of the people Bob interacted with, but there was no one with Clarke as their last name There were not a lot of entrepreneurs or powerful people with Clarke as their last name in Riverdale. Bob was taken aback. He could not hide his happiness, but at the same time, he was frowning. He did not know any Clarkes who was that rich. Bob looked at everyone in the room and asked,</p>  <p id = > “Do any of you know this Mr. Clarke? Stop hiding if you do. He invested so much money, we have to go visit him.” In the end, after looking around…</p>  <p id = > Everyone shook their heads in confusion. “Dad, I don’t know any Mr.</p>  <p id = > Clarkes.” “Me neither.” In an instant, everyone was stumped. No one knew any Mr. Clarkes, so who was this Mr. Clarke? Immediately, the news spread</p>  <p id = > around the party. “Damn! Did you guys hear what happened? Some rich guy named Clarke invested one billion dollars into the Yates’ business!” “What?</p>  <p id = > One billion dollars?” “Which Mr. Clarke? He’s so rich! I want him as my father.” In a blink of an eye, the entire center court and outer courtyard were starting to talk about this. Mr. Clarke’s name was like the wind. It blew all over the Yates’ courtyard. Almost everyone at the party now knew that a billionaire named Clarke invested one billion dollars into the Yates’</p>  <p id = > business. What a huge amount! Everyone could not describe their shock.</p>  <p id = > The Yates family was going to be famous today! Four simultaneous happy events happened in the family today. Philip sat on his seat and frowned.</p>  <p id = > Why did that feel like something Buffer would do? Just as he thought about it, he got a message on his other phone. He opened it and saw that it was indeed from Buffer. It said, ‘Dear Master Philip, it’s done. I invested one billion dollars into your wife’s grandfather’s business.’ It was Buffy! Philip was feeling helpless. Buffy was too kind. After pondering for a while, Philip replied, ‘Okay.’ Since Buffy had already invested the money, what else could he do? He did not need the one billion anyway, so he would just treat it as a gift. When Wynn heard the news, she glued her eyes on Philip. Was it him? Maybe not. Wynn got rid of that thought quickly. It was an investment of one billion dollars! Even if Philip’s parents owned Northern Sky Western Restaurant, they would not have so much money for investments. Bob was extremely excited. He and his children followed the middle-aged man from the hall to the center court. Then, they walked past the outer courtyard to see who this Mr. Clarke was. Eric walked past Philip coincidentally. He said sarcastically, “Hey, Grandpa, is this the Mr. Clarke you’re looking for?” It was obvious that Eric did that on purpose. Philip was just a coward. It would be a feat if he could take out 10,000 bucks. One billion? No way! When Aaron heard that, he laughed in disdain and said,</p>  <p id = > “Haha! Eric, this Mr. Clarke is not that Mr. Clarke. It’s obvious that he gets his meals from the dumpster.” Hahahaha! Everyone started laughing when they heard that. Martha followed behind everyone with her face crestfallen.</p>  <p id = > She did not want to say anything. She just did not want to bother herself with this matter right now. Philip would be the one feeling embarrassed. She did not want to get involved in this. After hearing Eric’s ominous laughter, Ted could not hold in his laughter anymore.</p>  <h2 id =chapter-194 > Chapter 194</h2>  <p id = > Bob glared coldly at Philip who was sitting on his seat. He snorted and said,</p>  <p id = > “Who does he think he is? What a sore sight!” With a scoff, Bob walked away with his black wood cane tapping on the ground. He was about to leave with his group of people. Philip had been enduring this kind of treatment for a long time. He sat on his seat indifferently and took a sip of his wine. He said calmly, “You can’t be sure that I’m not Mr.Clarke.” At first, everyone was shocked. Then, they started laughing loudly. Was Philip an idiot? How dare he say something like this? “Damn! Philip, why don’t you take a look at yourself in the mirror? Aside from your last name, what part of you looks like a rich person?” Eric laughed in frustration. How could such a shameless person exist? He was hilarious! Philip did not say anything. He knew they would not believe him even if he told them. Bob and his group of people snorted and went out of the door. In a blink of an eye, only a few people were left in the courtyard. Jess did not leave. She looked at Philip and said coldly, “Philip, I think you’re problematic. You boast too much. If you continue acting like this, I suggest that you divorce Wynn.” Her good impression of him was gone in an instant. Philip was speechless. He smiled awkwardly but still remained polite. Why did no one believe him? A moment later, Bob brought his group of people back to the scene. They were all smiling brightly. They kept on congratulating Bob. The scene was lively and cheerful. However, some people were still looking at Philip in detest.</p>  <p id = > Philip did not feel good about this. “This is wonderful! The Yates family is finally showing its face in Riverdale!” Bob was excited. “Dad, who is this Mr. Clarke? Why did he invest in our business?” Samson asked while frowning. He wanted to get to know a person like this. He believed that a</p>  <p id = > man who could invest one billion bucks would definitely have a net worth of more than ten billion bucks. This man would definitely be on the top of the list in the country. Could it be those people? It did not seem like it. Bob shook his head and said, “Let’s not think about it. Since he does not want to reveal his identity, then we should just wait. We’ll meet him eventually.</p>  <p id = > You people have to pay more attention to this. Tell me the moment you find Mr. Clarke. The Yates will definitely go and pay him a visit.” The party continued. At this moment, news broke in the hall. “Dad, there is a party in Cirrus Manor next month. They’ve invited a number of famous people.</p>  <p id = > We’ve been invited as well,” Samsom smiled and said. It was an honor to be invited to a party in Cirrus Manor. Cirrus Manor was an enigma. It was extremely mysterious. Rumors had it that the owner of the manor was good at toadying for personal gain. They had an extremely powerful influence and an unimaginable amount of wealth. This was the first party Cirrus Manor ever held. The rich and powerful in Riverdale valued this party greatly. They needed to have a certain level of power and wealth to be invited by the owner of Cirrus Manor. “Grandpa, what kind of place is Cirrus Manor? Is it really that tremendous?” Eric asked curiously. Ted explained briefly and in an instant, everyone in the hall fell into a state of shock. What kind of luck did the Yates have this year? They were having waves after waves of good things happening to them. Naturally, Bob was ecstatic. He was looking forward to this, and he also placed great value on this party. “Alright, when the time comes, Pete, Sam, Teddy, Eric, and Jessy will be coming with me. Six of us can attend the party.” Bob smiled with his eyes squinted. When Eric heard that, he felt like he was on cloud nine.</p>  <p id = > He drank some more wine and found a chance to slip out to the outer courtyard. Then, he purposely walked toward Philip and Wynn. “Philip, Wynn, let me tell you something. I’m going to the party at Cirrus Manor next month. How's it? Are you jealous? I know you are. Only someone like me can attend a party like that. “Oh, right. I think you don’t even know what kind of place Cirrus Manor is, right? Hahaha!” Eric was pleased with</p>  <p id = > himself. Plus, he had a little too much to drink, so he felt like he was walking on clouds. His tone was laced with arrogance. Philip was shocked when he heard that. Cirrus Manor? What was Giada trying to do? Even though Wynn hated Eric for flaunting after getting some goodies, she was still feeling slightly jealous. She had heard about Cirrus Manor. It was an amazing place!</p>  <p id = > The owner of the manor had an extremely powerful background. Anyone who could meet them would have a bright future! When he saw Wynn like that, Philip got close to her and asked, “Do you want to go? If you want, I can take you.”</p>  <h2 id =chapter-195 > Chapter 195</h2>  <p id = > Eric guffawed. His face was filled with contempt. He pointed at Philip and said, “F*ck me! What did you say, Philip? You’re taking Wynn there? How are you going to take her there? You’re just a piece of trash! “Do you know what kind of place Cirrus Manor is? It’s the most mysterious manor in Riverdale! It cost the owners one billion to build! “Are you saying that you’re qualified to be invited to the party?” Eric could not contain himself.</p>  <p id = > He said all kinds of horrible and sarcastic remarks. He attracted the attention of a few people in just a short while. They started laughing at Philip too.</p>  <p id = > Philip was simply humiliating himself! He was still trying to boast when things had already come to this. Wynn’s face was also burning. She kicked Philip under the table to tell him to stop talking. She was plenty embarrassed already but Philip would not stop talking! Would he only stop after he had beef with everyone? When she thought about this, Wynn was starting to get angry. However, she was still tolerable toward Philip. She said softly,</p>  <p id = > “That’s enough. Stop talking. Do you have to make a fool out of us?” Philip was speechless. He touched his nose and nodded. He did not say anything anymore. He knew Wynn was unhappy. Anyone would be unhappy if they were constantly targeted. Plus, these irrelevant people even dug out something that happened three years ago to gossip about. Of course Wynn would feel unhappy about that. After a while, Wynn got up to use the</p>  <p id = > restroom. Eric looked at Philip coldly. He put his foot on the table and said provocatively, “Philip, I have a whole new level of respect toward you.</p>  <p id = > You’re just a piece of trash and you dare to sit here and eat?” After he said that, Eric picked up a glass of red wine and poured it on top of Philip’s head.</p>  <p id = > The wine flowed all the way from Philip’s head to his feet. In an instant, everyone started making a commotion. Eric was too arrogant! Philip sat there while drenched in wine. He clenched his fists tightly as anger exploded in his heart! Bam! Philip could not take this anymore. He got up and kicked Eric on the chest. Eric did not expect Philip to react all of a sudden, so he stumbled backward from the impact and knocked over another table. “F*ck!</p>  <p id = > Philip, how dare you f*cking kick me? Do you want to die? Do you know this is the Yates’ party? You’re asking to die!” Eric was livid. He clenched his teeth and clutched his stomach. He doubled over and yelled at Philip while pointing at him. This sudden commotion attracted the attention of Bob and everyone else in the hall. “What’s going on?” Samson was the first to run out. When he saw his son’s pale face from getting kicked, he charged over to Philip and lifted his hand to slap him across the cheek. At the same time, he roared angrily, “Philip, you’re too arrogant! Where do you think this is? How dare you cause trouble here?” However, Samson’s hand did not land on anything. It was caught by Philip mid-air. Philip was livid. There was a fire burning in his eyes. He stared at Samson and yelled, “Go ahead!</p>  <p id = > Touch me! Do you believe that I’ll make the Yates disappear from Riverdale?” Wow! Everyone could not come back to their senses for a while. Was this something a good-for-nothing would say? Was Philip crazy? How dare he talk to Samson like this! Oh no, he was completely done for! Martha was standing behind the old master. Her face looked frantic and horrified. Philip was going to kill her with frustration. Could he not finish his food quietly and get lost? He just had to cause trouble. Slap! Martha walked out and lifted her hand. She slapped Philip across the cheek without saying anything. “Philip, what are you doing? Who are you to be so arrogant here? Who gave you the courage? Get lost!” Martha yelled. She was going</p>  <p id = > to go mad from anger! If the old master was mad, not only Philip, but she would not benefit from that as well! Eric stood at one side and pretended to be in immense pain. He pointed at Philip and cried to Bob, “Grandpa, look at him. He doesn’t respect the Yates family at all. He’s making a ruckus at your party!” Bob was furious. He slammed his cane on the floor and approached Philip. He glared at him and said, “You! Get out of my house now!” Old Master Yates was furious. Everyone looked at Philip with a fake smile on their faces. They were basking in his humiliation. This was what they loved doing the most. Philip let go of Samson’s hand and glared at everyone. The Yates was such a hilarious family. They were a nest of snakes and rats! “Bob Yates, remember what you said. I hope you won’t beg me to come back in the future,” Philip said coldly. Bob snorted. “Me? Begging for you to come back? Do you think the Yates family needs a lousy grandson-in-law?” Even so, when Bob met Philip’s gaze, his heart still skipped a beat.</p>  <p id = > Why was this guy looking at them like this? He was looking at them with disdain and contempt. How dare he look down on the Yates! What right did he have to say something like that? When everyone was fighting furiously, Wynn came back. When she saw what happened, she kept on apologizing to everyone. “Grandpa, I’m sorry. It’s all my fault. I didn’t control him well.</p>  <p id = > Please stop being mad at him. We’ll leave soon.” Wynn pulled Philip behind her and said apologetically. Jess could not watch this anymore. She chimed in, “Grandpa, I think that’s enough. After all, we’re family. Let Wynn take Philip back after this.” Bob scoffed. He did not say anything before turning around to leave. Eric glared at Philip in a despotic manner. He flipped him the bird arrogantly. Wynn did not say anything. She pulled Philip to the restroom and wiped his face for him. Then, she helped him remove his clothing and rubbed it between her hands to dry. Then, she blew it with a dryer. “Are you mad at me?” Philip was shirtless as he stood at one side and watched Wynn dry his shirt. She was so gentle and sensible. This was his wife, a woman who could be the brightest star among all. However, she married a man who was called a spineless coward by everyone. “No,” Wynn</p>  <p id = > said. However, the tears in her eyes betrayed how she really felt. She knew Eric was the culprit. “Why are you crying?” Philip felt uneasy. Wynn wiped her tears and hugged him. She sobbed, “Philip, let’s go home. We’ll never come here again. I don’t want to see them humiliating you. You’re my husband. You’re my husband…” Philip was shocked. His heart started filling with warmth. He held Wynn tightly and patted her back. He said,</p>  <p id = > “It’s fine, Wynnie. It’s just a small matter. Don’t worry about me.” The sunlight penetrated the window and they were basking in the golden light.</p>  <p id = > An unknown amorous mood ignited between the two of them.</p>  <h2 id =chapter-196 > Chapter 196</h2>  <p id = > Bang! The door of the restroom kicked open and Jess barged in. When she saw the sight before her, she turned around to leave. Before she left, however, she turned around and said, “You’ve been married for so long.</p>  <p id = > Find someplace better if you want to be intimate with each other.” After Jess left, Philip said in annoyance, “There must be something wrong with this woman’s head. She can’t bear to see a husband and a wife being happy.”</p>  <p id = > Wynn rolled her eyes at him and approached him. She straightened her back and buttoned Philip’s shirt for him. Philip wanted to continue but Wynn smacked his hand away. “Stop being unsatisfied with small gains. Let’s go.”</p>  <p id = > Philip shrugged helplessly. He murmured, “We’ve been husband and wife for so long. What are you scared of?” Wynn turned around and displayed a pleasing smile. She looked seductive under the sun. When they got back to</p>  <p id = > the party, it was nearing the end. Philip had just sat down for one minute when he got George’s message. ‘Young Master, it’s ready. Just wait for the surprise.’ Weird. What did that mean? Philip replied quickly, ‘Old Man George, what do you mean?’ At this moment, George was sitting in his Bentley and was on his way to Yates Village. He replied, ‘Young Master, you’re the main character of the Yates’ party. Please wait, they should be there already.’ Damn it! Damn it! Did George do something behind his back? While Philip was scratching his head in confusion, one of the servants ran over from the door and announced loudly, “Russell Field, the chairman of Civil Trading Group, is here! “His gift is a painting by Qi Baishi named</p>  <p id = > ‘Shrimp’!” Everyone was shocked. Why were there other guests arriving at the Old Master Yates’ party? Inside the hall, everyone was looking at each other. Everyone knew about Civil Trading Group. Their assets were worth three billion bucks. It was one of the top ten companies in Riverdale. Russell was one of the well-known collectors in the country! Also, ‘Shrimp’ by Qi Baishi was a famous painting! It was bid with ten million bucks back then!</p>  <p id = > It was such an expensive gift! However, the Yates family had no relations with Russell. Why was this important person here to congratulate Old Master Yates? Who was that powerful person who invited him? Bob was excited. He got up quickly and walked out to welcome him. A group of people followed him. He asked, “Did Mr. Field say who he came here for?”</p>  <p id = > “Yes, he said he’s here for Mr. Clarke,” said the man. Mr. Clarke again!</p>  <p id = > Who was this Mr. Clarke? Philip was the only Clarke at the scene. However, aside from the weird glances from Wynn and Jess, no one else even thought of him. One after another, everyone walked out to welcome Russell.</p>  <h2 id =chapter-197 > Chapter 197</h2>  <p id = > Bob was beyond excited at this moment. Russell was here and was even gifting him ‘Shrimp’ by Qi Baishi. This was such a precious gift! Not everyone was able to give out such luxurious gifts. Everyone followed behind Bob and came to the outer courtyard. Then, they got to the entrance.</p>  <p id = > Eric was the last one to arrive. When he saw that Philip did not move, he said in despise, “What’s wrong? An important man like Russell Field is here and you don’t want to go and welcome him?” Did this guy have nails on his bottom? How could he still sit there? After Eric’s reminder, Philip thought about it and came to the conclusion that Eric’s words made sense. He got up and followed Wynn as well as the rest of the crowd. However, he stood a few meters away from the crowd. He did not want to go to the front. Philip did not want to get involved in something like this. Everyone stood at the door respectfully. A black Maybach stopped at the entrance. In an instant, the car door was opened and Russell got out of the car with a smile on his face. Bob walked out with a huge grin on his face. He spread his hands and said respectfully, “Mr. Field, I didn’t expect an important man like you to come to my humble abode and celebrate my birthday with me. What did I do to deserve this?” Bob did amazingly well on his courtesies. Russell reached out his hand and held his. He congratulated Old Master Yates.</p>  <p id = > “How can I be absent for Old Master Yates’ birthday party? That’s why I came uninvited. I hope you don’t blame me.” Russell did come here uninvited. Plus, he showed up only because he got a message from George.</p>  <p id = > George needed him to show up so that Philip could keep up appearances.</p>  <p id = > Russell was puzzled by this though. Did a man like Mr. Clarke need his help to keep up appearances? Bob smiled and asked, “Um, Mr. Field, why didn’t you tell me before coming here? If you had, I could’ve sent someone to pick you up.” Russell shook his hands and said, “Phil is here, so I thought I should come here to congratulate you as well so it’s more joyous.” “Phil?”</p>  <p id = > Bob was puzzled. His face was filled with confusion. At the same time, Russell saw Philip among the crowd. Instantly, his face brightened. That was the god of wealth! He invested two billion in his company! In an instant, Russell ignored Bob and the crowd. He rushed over to Philip with a respectful smile on his face. “Mr… Phil, you’re here! Did I come on time?”</p>  <p id = > Russell was respected by so many, but now, he was being extremely respectful to Philip. “Why are you here?” Philip was confused. Today was</p>  <p id = > Old Master Yates’ birthday party. Why was Russel here? Damn it! This was indeed a cheap trick by that old George Thomas. He was forcing him to expose himself! “I heard that you’re here so I came all the way to give Old Master Yates a birthday gift. What do you think? Shrimp is a good gift, right?” Russell smiled deviously. Philip was a top tier nouveau riche.</p>  <p id = > George told him a little about his assets. He would have 100 billion in just one card of his. Russell had a clever mind. He had to curry favors with a hidden heir of a billionaire. This way, it would be beneficial to the development of his business and would bring him an abundance of wealth and opportunities. At this moment, Bob and his group of people ran over while yelling, “Mr. Field! Mr. Field, what are you doing?” Bob glanced at Philip coldly and said, “Mr. Field, why don’t we talk inside? It’s hot out here and it’s much cooler in the courtyard. Plus, why are you talking to him?</p>  <p id = > He’s just a nobody who’s too inferior to show in public.” It was obvious Bob was still mad at Philip. A good-for-nothing like him was just decreasing his lifespan by appearing at his party. Now, Russell was here too. If Philip made a fool of himself, it would be bad. When that happened, Bob and the Yates would be extremely humiliated. However, who would expect that Russell, with a net worth of more than three billion, would want to humbly stand at the door next to Philip. His expression changed. He peered at Bob with the manner of a chairman, “Old Master, it’s not shameful standing here with Phil.” Bob’s eyes widened as his jaw dropped. He asked, “Phil? Mr.</p>  <p id = > Field, you came here for Philip?” Russell was annoyed that Bob was being so disrespectful to Philip. He was even regretting giving that gift to him.</p>  <p id = > When he was about to say something, he saw Philip hinting at him with his eyes. He immediately got what he meant.</p>  <h2 id =chapter-198 > Chapter 198</h2>  <p id = > Russel smiled and said, “Oh, Phil and I bonded through collecting. He’s one of my most intimate friends. We’re kindred spirits.” Intimate friends?</p>  <p id = > Kindred spirits? Bob was shocked. Everyone was also taken aback. What</p>  <p id = > was going on? Philip was just a spineless bum. How did he know an entrepreneur with a net worth of a few billion bucks like Russell? Was Philip a collector as well? Impossible. He was so poor. Did he have the money to collect? Eric and Aaron were surprised. Philip even knew someone like this?! They had underestimated him. “I didn’t expect that Russell came here for Philip.” Everyone’s jaws dropped. Was this a joke? “Russell is a famous collector in the country and is worth more than three billion. Why is such an important man so respectful toward Philip? Something’s not right.” Jess was meticulous. She stood among the crowd and sensed that something was amiss. However, when she looked at Philip closely, she could not imagine him being a billionaire or a nouveau riche. The reason was that it was simply impossible. Charles was the only one frowning. He wondered if Russell and Philip had made friends with each other in the gallery last time. Fortunately, Philip was not embarrassing them again this time. There was a smile on Martha’s face. She was pleased, especially when she stood in front of her sister Paula. She was like a cocky rooster when she said, “See? Our Philip is not that bad. He’s better than your Frank. That’s Russell Field! He’s worth three billion and he’s still so courteous with Philip.” Paula’s face went white. She had been putting down her sister and showing off the entire time.</p>  <p id = > Now that the tables had turned, she felt extremely uncomfortable. This feeling turned into anger and hatred toward Philip. ‘Damn you, Philip. You should just stay as a piece of trash forever. What the hell are you doing?’ “I didn’t think Philip was so good at hiding. I didn’t expect him to know Russell.” Some people lamented. They thought that Philip had gotten himself some goodies. However, the crowd did not bother with this. When Charles explained that they knew each other from the gallery and were not that close, everyone started to look down on him again. Philip was just making a coat out of a tiger’s fur! How pretentious. A relationship like that would be forgotten in a blink of an eye. One could not take out something that did not belong to them. Plus, Philip was just a hopeless good-for-nothing. However, what happened next shocked everyone. When Bob</p>  <p id = > invited Russell into the courtyard, Russell held out his hand in the same gesture and invited Philip inside. Philip felt awkward. Wynn was standing next to him like a curious child. She stared at him and pinched the flesh on his waist. She bit her lip and muttered, “Philip, explain to me when we get home.” Philip smiled bitterly. What was going on? ‘George Thomas, you’re f*cking ruining my life!’ Philip could not reject him, so he could only brace himself and walk in front of everyone with Wynn next to him. He could feel more than ten cold stares on his back. They were stabbing into his body like a thousand arrows. When they were in the courtyard, everyone sat back down. Naturally, Russell sat inside the hall after being led by Bob. When Eric saw that everyone was in the hall and middle court, he decided to stay in the outer courtyard. He mocked while feeling pleased with himself,</p>  <p id = > “Philip, I didn’t expect a piece of trash like you to know an entrepreneur and collector like Russell. What a lucky bastard!” Even though he was smiling, his voice was laced with sarcasm. Everyone was able to tell. Philip frowned slightly, the unhappiness in his heart getting more intense. Eric was such a misfortune to the Yates family. However, Philip ignored him. He was just a worthless fool, so why should he bother with him? On the other side, Russel had just sat down. When he saw Philip at the corner of the outer courtyard being mocked by Eric with a fake smile on his face, he felt agitated. Any smart person could tell that only the most disrespected person would sit there. “I’m sorry, everyone. Let me sit over there,” Russell said.</p>  <p id = > He announced to everyone and ran impatiently to the outer courtyard. “Phil, can I sit next to you?” he asked in a humble tone. Everyone was stunned.</p>  <p id = > They did not expect Russell to be so respectful to Philip. What was going on? Was their relationship really that simple? Why was Russell so respectful to Philip? “Up to you, Mr. Field,” Philip said calmly. Russell was gleeful.</p>  <p id = > He sat down next to Philip hurriedly and poured a glass of wine for Philip.</p>  <p id = > Eric saw this and could feel a fire burning his cheeks. It felt like a million slaps had just landed on his face loudly. He was so f*cking pissed! What was the reason behind this?! At the same time, an announcement sounded</p>  <p id = > at the entrance once again. “The chairman from Riverdale Theodorus Charity Organization, Mr. Theo Zander, is here! “His gift is a statue Bodhisattva of Compassion made out of white jade!”</p>  <h2 id =chapter-199 > Chapter 199</h2>  <p id = > “Theo Zander? Which Theo Zander?” “Mr. Theo Zander from Theodorus Charity Organization?” “The underground king of Riverdale, Theo Zander?</p>  <p id = > Why is he here?” Before the relatives and younger generation of the Yates in the courtyard came back to their senses, everyone in the hall was starting to get antsy. Compared to an entrepreneur and well-known collector like Russell, Theo was popular in Riverdale because of his power with the dark side. If a powerful man like that did not come here sincerely, it could be said that he was here to take someone’s life. It was only natural for Bob to be nervous. Not everyone could get in touch with a powerful man like Theo.</p>  <p id = > Plus, no ordinary person could invite him to anything. While everyone was in a state of shock, Theo was already walking into the courtyard with a smile on his face. His white suit and fedora were radiating an air of dominance.</p>  <p id = > One would feel like they were being crushed by a mountain with his presence. It was Theo Zander indeed—the underground king of Riverdale!</p>  <p id = > His overbearing presence dominated the entire party. Jess was shocked. This was an extremely powerful and famous man in Riverdale. Why was he at the Yates’ family party? Her grandpa did not know him. After a while, Jess’</p>  <p id = > eyes landed on Philip who was sitting calmly. Russell came here because of him, so was Theo also here for him? No way! Impossible! A man like Theo would not just see anyone. Samson was the first one who approached him.</p>  <p id = > He had a lot of business relations with Theo’s company, so he knew Theo.</p>  <p id = > Aside from Russell, not a single person in the party had as much wealth and power as Theo. As such, Samson was super excited. He had to entertain this man well. ‘I didn’t expect to attract a person of this caliber to our party.’</p>  <p id = > Peter and Bob walked over quickly. “Hello, my dear Samson,” Theo nodded his head slightly and said. The two had business relations, so they met a few</p>  <p id = > times. However, they were not close. In the next second, everyone’s eyes widened as they lifted their ears. “Hello, Old Master Yates. I’m here for Mr.</p>  <p id = > Clarke,” Theo said with a smile. His eyes were already on Philip who was sitting near the door. “Mr. Clarke?” Bob walked over and squinted his eyes.</p>  <p id = > He was puzzled. “Which Mr. Clarke? I’ll ask someone to call him over.” In Bob’s eyes, only an influential and powerful person could make Theo show up at his party. The only person here with Clarke as their last name was Philip. Was it him? Impossible! He was just a spineless bum! Everyone at the party was curious. A powerful man like Theo was here for someone.</p>  <p id = > How powerful was that person? Plus, that person also had Clarke as their last name? Everyone’s eyes shifted to Philip who was sitting at the corner.</p>  <p id = > Before this, Russell had come all the way for him. Was Theo also here for him? “Does that good-for-nothing know Theo? How is that possible? This is so weird,” Paula said in jealousy. She felt like she had just eaten ten catties of lemon. “That piece of trash knows Theo Zander? No way! He’s just a piece of trash. This must be a joke.” Eric was unhappy. His eyebrows were knitted together tightly. All of a sudden, he felt like he did not understand that coward anymore. Why did he feel an air of mysteriousness surrounding that guy? Initially, he was not concerned about Philip at all. However, he started to feel alarmed when he saw Russell’s attitude toward him. Now, Theo was here. Wynn did not say anything. She sat next to Philip with her eyes glued on him. There was curiosity in her eyes. She felt that something was different about her husband. Did his family only own restaurants? When everyone was looking over at Philip in puzzlement, that guy was merely drinking his soup calmly. It was as if he was not bothered at all. “Am I mistaken?” Bob was puzzled. Then, he shook his head. However, in the next second, something caused everyone at the party to open their mouths in surprise. Theo walked through the crowd and strode over to Philip. He put his hands together and said respectfully to him, “Mr. Clarke, it’s so difficult to get in contact with you.” Theo Zander, the underground king of Riverdale was so respectful toward Philip. It was as if a student was greeting his</p>  <p id = > teacher. “You’re here as well?” Philip frowned. He was unhappy. What the hell was George planning? Did he want the entire world to know? How should he explain to Wynn when he got back? Before Theo got here, he received George’s message. He told him to be low-profile but at the same time, he could not bring shame to Philip. That was why he addressed Philip like that. When he saw that Philip was unhappy, Theo trembled in fear. Cold sweat started to drench his back. Did he say the wrong thing? Just like that, Theo stood respectfully behind Philip while the latter was still drinking his soup. He did not even try to be courteous. With that, everyone’s breathing started getting heavier and heavier.</p>  <h2 id =chapter-200 > Chapter 200</h2>  <p id = > That was Theo Zander! Philip did not know what was good for him. How dare he be so disrespectful? Bob was the first one to be mad. He yelled at Philip, “Philip, since Mr. Zander is here for you, why are you still sitting?</p>  <p id = > Who do you think you are? Do you have no manners?” After Bob’s angry shouting, Eric, Aaron, and some other people started berating him as well.</p>  <p id = > “Philip, stand up and apologize to Mr. Zander now!” “That piece of trash really thinks that he’s someone special.” They were saying more and more nasty things about Philip. These people did not like Philip for a very long time now. They finally had a chance to chime in. If Theo got angry, Philip would be done for! However, Philip only lifted his head slightly and looked at everyone. Then, he grabbed the ladle and took some soup for Wynn. He said, “This is not bad. It’s good for your body. You should drink more.”</p>  <p id = > Damn it! Bob was seething! This piece of trash was completely disrespecting him! When he was about to yell at him again, Philip said calmly, “Sit.” “Alright!” Theo let out a breath of relief and sat down happily.</p>  <p id = > He sat next to Russell and they nodded at each other when their eyes met.</p>  <p id = > What the f*ck? What the hell was going on? This was getting so weird.</p>  <p id = > Everyone looked at Philip in disbelief. Then, they looked at Theo again.</p>  <p id = > Theo really sat down like an obedient subordinate. This must be fake! It</p>  <p id = > must be! Everyone was in a state of shock. They inhaled sharply. Even Bob had to swallow his words back into his throat for the first time ever. He had to reevaluate his opinions on his grandson-in-law. Bob was confused. He asked in disbelief, “Mr. Zander, the Clarke you’re looking for is Philip Clarke?” “Of course! Clarke and I are best friends,” Theo said calmly. His expression was neutral, but there was a hint of anger. He had heard what the old master said when he was yelling at Philip earlier. These people were blind. They did not know who they were offending and were still trying to be ferocious. Everyone gasped. Theo knew this spineless bum? Eric was seething. How was this possible? Philip was just a piece of trash that everyone hated and despised. How could he sit at the same table as Theo?</p>  <p id = > On the other hand, Jess was staring at Philip. This guy only had one nose, two eyes, and one mouth like the rest of them. Was Philip not just a normal guy? Wynn was shocked. She pinched Philip’s thigh under the table and asked in a low voice while frowning, “Philip, what’s going on? How do you know Theo Zander?” She knew about Russell. He was a successful entrepreneur and also a collector. She had also heard about Theo. He was a famous boss on the dark side. How did Philip know this kind of person?</p>  <p id = > Theo chuckled at Wynn and nodded his head. He greeted, “Mrs. Clarke.”</p>  <p id = > Mrs. Clarke? Wynn was shocked. She sat with her back straightened and drank her soup. Everyone around them was also shocked. This was Theo Zander they were talking about! The Theo Zander who would murder someone without blinking an eye! Did… Did he just call Wynn Mrs.</p>  <p id = > Clarke? Oh my gosh! What a huge piece of news! When Philip heard that, he frowned and glared at Theo. Theo knew he made a mistake and shut up immediately. He lowered his head and could not control the tremble in his eyes. At the same time, everyone was even more confused with Philip and Theo’s relationship. It was not as clear cut as his relationship with Russell.</p>  <p id = > Charles and Martha were also puzzled. When did their useless son-in-law have connections with a VIP like Theo? He was someone who could shake the entire Riverdale with a stomp of a foot. … At this moment, everyone</p>  <p id = > was looking at the table nearest to the door with weird glances. Philip, Wynn, Russell, and Theo were chatting about something with smiles on their faces. Peter could still keep his cool. He had seen all kinds of things when he was in the organization. However, he could not press down his curiosity toward Philip. Who was Martha’s son-in-law? Paula was sitting together with Samantha. They were looking at that table in anger. “Is Theo a fake? How can he sit with that useless bum?” She was envious and jealous, especially when she saw Martha and Charles sitting there to curry favors.</p>  <p id = > Her face started to feel hot. Martha was criticizing her son-in-law just a few moments ago. Now, she was trying to curry favors with him? What a b*tch!</p>  <p id = > Soon after, Paula got her father’s orders to go over and find out what was going on. At the same time, an announcement sounded at the door again.</p>  <p id = > “The chairman of Apex Group, Mr. George Thomas, is here!” When everyone heard that name, they could not sit still anymore. Bob and his group of people jumped up in excitement. Their faces were red, and they started breathing heavily. “Why is George Thomas here?” He was the richest man in Riverdale!</p>  <h2 id =chapter-201 > Chapter 201</h2>  <p id = > George Thomas the billionaire! What prestige and fame he had! He had a net worth of more than ten billion and was the legend of Riverdale. The amount of wealth and connections he had could not be imagined by anyone at the scene. A powerful man like him was at Old Master Yates’ party. No one would have thought of this happening! When they heard George’s name, everyone in the hall and outer courtyard started gasping. They fell into a state of shock. Everyone at the scene including Bob, Peter, and Samson stood up. Russell and Theo also stood up to get ready to welcome this VVIP. “Who would’ve expected George Thomas to show up?”</p>  <p id = > Everyone was scared. There were ominous glints in their eyes. They all stared at the entrance at the same time. They wanted so badly to see the legendary billionaire of Riverdale to appear at the door. A few luxury cars</p>  <p id = > stopped outside the door of Yates Manor. Then, George got out of a black Bentley. He was wearing a grey Tang suit and holding a cane. He slowly made his way to the entrance. Bob and his group of people were already at the door. They were the first to witness the refined George Thomas walking over. “It’s really George Thomas!” Bob could not stand still anymore. He walked over and welcomed George personally. Even though there was not much difference in their ages, it was obvious that Geroge looked more energetic. He had a blush and a glow on his face. “Mr. Thomas, I didn’t expect you to visit me in my humble abode,” Bob said flatteringly. He had a grin on his face. “My dear Bob, I heard you’re celebrating your 70th birthday, so I decided to crash the party,” George shook hands with Bob and said flatly. When he said that, everyone figured that this was the Yates family lucky year. They had four simultaneous happy events, and now, VIPs were coming here to congratulate Old Master Yates. However, everyone could not help but cast their glances at Philip who was sitting in the outer courtyard. Did he come for Philip as well? If that was the case, then he had just accomplished an unattainable task! That was the richest man in Riverdale! Philip was just a useless piece of trash. What did he do to claim connections with powerful people like them? Before this, they thought that Theo’s prestige and fame were all fake. If not, how could he be</p> <p id = > so respectful toward a useless bum? Then, in the next second, George said something that widened everyone’s eyes. “Um… Is my little boy Philip here?” George asked with a grin. When Bob heard that, his hands trembled. He almost collapsed. Eric and the rest of the group felt as if a large hammer had fallen from the sky and landed on their hearts. They felt that everything that knew was starting to crumble around them. They did not expect to be right. The billionaire of Riverdale, George Thomas, was also here for Philip! Jess was starting to feel numb. Russell Field, Theo Zander, George Thomas… All of them had a net worth more than billions, and they were all here for Philip!</p>  <p id = > Was that spineless bum really a good-for-nothing? Bob came back to his senses and replied, “Yes.” Then, he led George into the courtyard. Everyone</p>  <p id = > followed suit. George greeted everyone and followed Bob into the hall.</p>  <p id = > “Mr.</p>  <p id = > Thomas, you came all the way from Riverdale. You must be exhausted.</p>  <p id = > Come, let me propose a toast to you,” Peter said. He had to flatter a billionaire like George. It would be beneficial to the Yates family and at the same time, it would be beneficial to him. “Haha, how can I be absent for Old Master Yates’ party?” George laughed. Then, his eyes landed on Martha and Charles who were sitting diagonally to him. “Mr. and Mrs. Johnston, hello. These are two little presents I brought for you two. I hope you can accept them.” After he said that, George asked his secretary to take out two little boxes and hand them to Charles and Martha respectfully. The two of them gladly accepted the gifts. Martha was especially ecstatic. This was a gift from Riverdale’s richest man. It must be extremely valuable! She was going to be rich! Everyone at the table was envious when they saw that.</p>  <p id = > They were looking at Martha with jealousy in their eyes. “Mr. Thomas, you’re too kind. How can I accept such an expensive gift?” Martha pretended to decline but still, she put away the box impatiently. It was as if she was scared that George would ask for it back. “Mrs. Johnston, you have an amazing son-in-law. He has a very bright future!” George laughed and said. “Philip?” Everyone fell into a state of shock again. They did not expect a billionaire like George to compliment that piece of trash. This was</p> <p id = > so unbelievable. Everyone was in disbelief. This was a birthday party for Old Master Yates. Philip had not done anything and somehow, he became the star of the party.</p>  <h2 id =chapter-202 > Chapter 202</h2>  <p id = > “Mr. Thomas, do you have the wrong person? Look at Philip’s wretched state, he’s just a hopeless case who everyone looks down on…” Paula was unconvinced, so she blurted out. Not only did she suspect that Theo was a fake, but now, she suspected George was a fake too. Who were they? Were they blind? How would they have any connections with a penniless fool like Philip? “Ma’am, please watch your language. No one can insult my little</p>  <p id = > Philip like that.” George’s tone was icy. Bob shouted as well, “Paula, shut up! One more word and you’re out of here!” Paula shut her mouth when she saw her father’s angry expression. She was as scared as a bird that was startled by the mere twang of a bow. She did not dare to lift her head anymore. Martha chuckled deviously. She said weirdly, “Oh, our Phil is the best indeed. He even knows a rich person like you, Mr. Thomas. Unlike some people whose daughter only got a nice husband after sleeping with God knows how many men. And she still dares to show off every day. How cheap.” Bob was used to the daily bickerings of his two daughters. He spoke up and stopped them. Paula was trembling with anger. She peered at Philip at the outer courtyard. Her heart was filled with anger and jealousy. What did Philip do? How could he claim relations with someone like George? Did he sell his wife? At the party, it was only natural for people to ask about Philip and George’s relationship. Before George could say anything, Martha could not wait to show off. She told them Philip had saved George and was George’s savior. When they heard this, everyone sighed breaths of relief.</p>  <p id = > However, if he was Geroge’s savior, there would be a huge chance for him to have a bright future. After less than ten minutes, George got up and walked to the outer courtyard. Everyone’s eyes followed him. After greeting Philip, George sat down at his table. In an instant, multiple eyes were glued on Philip. Bewilderment, jealousy, envy, and disbelief were among some of the complicated emotions in their gazes. However, Philip was calm. He even started to complain about this. “Old Man George, what are you playing?”</p> <p id = > Philip asked. George only smiled and said, “Young Master, didn’t you ask me to prepare a gift? How’s this?” Pfft! Philip almost spat out his drink.</p>  <p id = > George was even more of a poser than he was! Ted was looking at Philip, and at that moment, he felt foreign to him. Who was this guy? Was he really just a spineless coward? He even started to understand what Philip had said earlier, something about making the Yates disappear from Riverdale. Was this guy so arrogant just because he knew a few people? Ted drank his wine quietly. His hands were trembling, and his heart was roaring in</p>  <p id = > dissatisfaction. ‘You’re just a piece of trash! How is it possible for you to know so many people? How? ‘This is the Yates Manor! A spineless bum like you is not allowed to cause trouble here! I, Eric Yates, am unconvinced!</p>  <p id = > I’ll kill you!’ While thinking about that, Eric exited the courtyard and ran to a corner. He dialed a number and said with a dark face, “Monkey, bring the boys and block the entrance of the village. I want to f*ck someone up! I want to cripple him! There’s also a woman. I’ll let you guys do anything you want to her as long as you don’t kill her.” Back to Philip. It was obvious that Philip’s table had become the highlight of the party even though it was near to the door. Everyone would cast glances at them occasionally. They were watching them closely. After spending some more time here, Wynn started to feel tired. Philip got up and said to George and the rest, “Um, I have to send Wynnie back now. If you have the time, you can help yourself to whatever you want.” When Wynn heard Philip’s tone, she glared at him and said, “Um, Mr. Field, Mr. Zander, Mr. Thomas, I’m so sorry. I don’t feel so good, so I’m going to ask Philip to send me back. I’ll take him to visit all of you one day.” When they heard that, Russell and Theo waved their hands and said, “No, no, no. There’s no need for that. Phil is so busy.</p>  <p id = > You don’t have to do that.” George was the only one sitting calmly. Wynn hesitated and looked at Philip. She smiled before following him out of the door. When everyone saw Wynn walking out with Philip, they let out sighs of relief. That guy was finally gone. After a while, George, Russell, and Theo left as well. Finally, the Yates’ party came to an end. When Russell was about to leave the courtyard, he was asked back to the drawing room in</p> <p id = > the hall by Bob. “Mr. Field, the reason I asked you here is for you to take a look at something for me.” Bob was grinning cheerfully. Then, he took out a small box and handed it to Russell. The three generations of Yates were all in the room. Of course, the Yates’ relatives were also there. Naturally, Charles was present too. “What’s this?” Russell was curious when he took the box. Bob was frowning slightly when he said, “This is from my grandson-in-law. I didn’t think it was worth anything, but now that you’re</p>  <p id = > here, I want to ask you to look at it for me.” To put it in simpler terms, Bob was suspicious. He wanted to get a clue through the box so that he could get rid of the qualm in his heart. What valuable thing could Philip afford to give him?</p>  <h2 id =chapter-203 > Chapter 203</h2>  <p id = > Bob knew about Philip’s relationship with Russell, and he knew that they were not that close. Naturally, his impression of Philip went back to how it was before. Philip and Russell just happened to know each other at a gallery.</p>  <p id = > That piece of trash was not worth mentioning at all. It was not just Bob waiting for Russell’s appraisal, the rest of the group was also anticipating the result. Russell did not decline. He opened the box, and at the first glance, he was attracted by the jade ornamental thumb ring. This… This jade ornamental thumb ring was definitely made from jade of the highest grade!</p>  <p id = > Judging from the craftsmanship and the level of polishing, this ring was not made recently but from the pre-Qing dynasty. Russell took out his magnifying glass from his pocket and started looking at it up close. With this gesture, everyone in the hall was being kept in surprise. What was going on? Was Philip’s jade ornamental thumb ring a genuine piece of antique?</p>  <p id = > Eric felt his heart sink. However, he got rid of this thought. It was just a piece of jade. How could it possibly be an antique? “How is it, Mr. Field?</p>  <p id = > Do you see anything?” Bob asked with a grin. He was super nervous. He had not felt this way for so many years. He did not know why he was so nervous for no reason. Bob could even predict what Russell would say next.</p>  <p id = > Judging from Russell’s expression, Bob could tell this ornamental thumb ring was not made from any normal jade. “This… This is a jade ornamental thumb ring from the Qing dynasty! It might even belong to Emperor Qianlong!” Russel said excitedly all of a sudden. He was emotional. He even started to breathe heavily. If it belonged to Emperor Qianlong, it must be extremely valuable! He had not seen anything like that for so many years!</p> <p id = > Russell remembered that he had bid for a piece of calligraphy that once</p>  <p id = > belonged to Emperor Qianlong in Capital City. It was sold at 30 million bucks. The value of this jade ornamental thumb ring was definitely more than 30 million bucks. It must be a valuable treasure! “Qing Dynasty…</p>  <p id = > Emperor Qianlong?” Bob was stunned. His eyes were wide as he stared at the jade ornamental thumb ring in Russell’s hand. In an instant, everyone in the hall was beyond shocked. Even the ones who did not know anything about antiques like Martha knew that it was something extremely valuable when she heard it once belonged to Emperor Qianlong from the Qing Dynasty. Eric’s face fell. Did that useless bum really give the old master something valuable? Where did he get the money? “Charlie, is that thing valuable?” Martha poked Charles and asked. If this was back then, Martha would do anything to take back that thumb ring. Philip was such a spendthrift. There were so many things in the world to give and yet he gave something that once belonged to Emperor Qianlong. Charles’ face was red.</p>  <p id = > He wanted so badly to pounce over and take a look. He said excitedly,</p>  <p id = > “Valuable! It’s extremely valuable! Two years ago, a piece of calligraphy from Emperor Qianlong was sold for 30 million bucks.” “What? 30</p>  <p id = > million?” Martha yelled out from excitement. In an instant, everyone’s attention was on Martha. She covered her mouth and smiled awkwardly.</p>  <p id = > However, Martha was hurling abuses at Philip in her heart. What a damn piece of trash! What a spendthrift! 30 million! However, in the next second, Russell shook his head and said, “Old Master Yates, I think this ring costs more than 30 million bucks.” More than 30 million? This news was making waves in the room. Bob was breathing heavily. His face was red as he stared at that thumb ring. He smiled in satisfaction and said, “Why don’t you give us an estimate for this, Mr. Field?” After pondering for a while, Russell lifted a finger and said solemnly, “At least 100 million.” 100 million? Thud!</p>  <p id = > When Martha heard that, she passed out on the spot. She fell backward and landed on the floor. Thankfully, Charles was agile enough. He helped</p> <p id = > Martha to one side quickly. He pressed down on her philtrum and fed her water before she regained consciousness. Martha was limp all over. Her</p>  <p id = > hands were trembling uncontrollably as she murmured resentfully, “Philip, oh, Philip, you spendthrift! Where did you get that thumb ring? It’s worth 100 million and you just gave it out like that.” Martha was seething. She stared at the ring and wanted so badly to swallow it. If Philip had not given it to her father, it would have been hers! 100 million! My gosh! No way, she had to get it back!</p>  <h2 id =chapter-204 > Chapter 204</h2>  <p id = > Martha decided to pretend to be sick. She grunted and pointed at her chest.</p>  <p id = > How would Bob not be able to tell his daughter’s little tricks? He glared at her coldly and yelled, “Martha, since Philip gave this to me, then it belongs to the Yates. If you don’t feel well, you should just ask Paula to send you back.” When she heard that, Martha did not dare to pretend anymore. She straightened her back, her face filled with hatred. Even though Paula was jealous, she still felt a little pleased when she saw that Martha could not get any goodies from this. Bob took the thumb ring from Russell with trembling hands. He valued it very much. 100 million! How did Philip afford to give him something so expensive? Eric, Aaron, and Jess were all beyond shocked. They were in disbelief. Was Philip not a completely useless piece of trash? How did he afford the thumb ring? Eric clenched his fists. Where did that guy get such a treasure? F*ck, f*ck, f*ck! He was fuming. Eric went to one side and urged Monkey and his gang to hurry up. Jess was also curious. She could not make sense of the situation no matter how hard she tried. What else was this guy hiding? At the same time, she spotted Eric standing alone at the corner on his phone. His face was filled with anger.</p>  <p id = > What was Eric doing? After pondering for a while, she took out her phone to send a message to Wynn telling her to be careful. Russell looked at everyone’s shocked faces. He felt helpless as well. They did not know that a thumb ring worth 100 million was merely just a toy for Philip. Mr. Clarke had previously told him to keep his identity a secret. As such, Russell explained quickly. “I think Philip must have gotten this ring from an antique</p>  <p id = > market. This guy has such a sharp eye. He found the ‘Friends and Spring Mountain’ painting by Tang Yin from an antique market as well.” “He found it? What’s going on?” Bob was puzzled. Russell explained briefly before everyone understood the situation. Their suspicions toward Philip vanished as well. It turned out that a useless piece of trash would always be a useless piece of trash. They thought Philip had a secret identity. Who knew it was just blind luck? What a lucky bastard! After Russell left, Bob</p> <p id = > asked his people to put away the thumb ring. The whole family looked at each other and smiled. That coward Philip was such an idiot. He might not even know the true worth of the thumb ring. Indeed, a good-for-nothing would not know the true worth of something valuable even if it was in front of him.</p>  <p id = > Eric started to look down on Philip even more. He would not amount to anything his entire life. Martha and Charles were furious. They left Yates Manor as well. “I’m so mad, I’m so mad! 100 million! It’s 100 million!</p>  <p id = > Charlie! Philip really wants us to die from anger!” On the way home, Martha kept on hurling abuses at Philip. She was seething. “That’s enough. He already gave it away. Do you think you can ask for it back?” Charles said helplessly. “Of course! Why not? That gift was from Philip, so it belongs to us. Why should it go to the Yates? No, I’m not leaving. You should go back first. I won’t go back until I get the ring.” Martha had made up her mind.</p>  <p id = > After all, she did not cultivate her snobbishness in just one or two days. How would she be willing to part with something so valuable? Back to Philip.</p>  <p id = > Wynn and Philip sat inside the car Theo had prepared for them. Inside the car, Wynn was very reserved. After all, the person in the front seat was the underground king of Riverdale. Philip knew Wynn was suspecting his identity, so he asked quickly, “Theo, thank you. You can just send me to the hospital.” Theo was shocked, but he understood. He replied with a smile,</p>  <p id = > “It’s fine. It’s nothing. Come have tea with me when you’re free. I have to thank you for what happened last time, Clarke.” What thing? Wynn was curious. Her eyes were glued on Philip as she pinched him on the waist. She bit her lip and muttered, “Philip, you have to explain this to me when we get</p>  <p id = > back.” Philip knew what she was thinking after looking into her eyes. He felt like he was in trouble. “Theo, I think we have some followers.” When they were about to go out of the village, the driver noticed something was off. “Clarke, what are you going to do with them?” Theo looked at the</p> <p id = > rearview mirror and asked. “Ignore them,” Philip replied calmly. He could guess who was behind this, but he did not want to make enemies now. Theo nodded and did not say anything. However, in a blink of an eye, the two vans behind chased up to them. One of the vans crashed into them and forced the Mercedes-Benz to stop. Seven to eight muscular men with tattoos got out of the two vans. They were holding things that looked like bats.</p>  <p id = > “You f*ckers! Get out! Get the f*ck out now!” The leader of the gang was a man with a buzzcut. He looked extremely violent. He smashed his steel bat on the Mercedes-Benz and pointed at the people inside. He roared while strutting around.</p>  <h2 id =chapter-205 > Chapter 205</h2>  <p id = > “Clarke, sit tight. I’ll handle this.” Theo said and dialed a number. He said coldly into the phone, “Ned, I’m at the entrance of Yates Village. Bring your men over.” After he said that, he removed his hat and took off his suit jacket.</p>  <p id = > He opened the door and walked out with his men. Philip smiled and got out as well. Wynn wanted to follow, but Philip kept her inside the car. Wynn should not have to watch what was going to happen next. “Which one of you mother*ckers is Philip Clarke? Get out here!” The leader was named Monkey. He was the local bully of this area at Yates Village. He would tyrannize this area to no end. He was also pushy and overbearing while thinking he was a big shot. He held a steel bat in his hand, and his face was filled with malice. He smashed his bat down on the hood of the Mercedes-Benz and yelled, “What’s wrong? Did you not hear me? Are y’all f*cking deaf? Get Philip Clarke out here and kowtow to me! And that woman named Wynn Johnston too! Come out here and go back with me so that the boys can have fun with you! If not, none of you will be allowed to leave!” “Do</p>  <p id = > you want to die? How dare you insult Mr. and Mrs. Clarke?” Theo walked forward and said with an icy face, “Are you bored of living?” He had been in this industry and working in Riverdale for so long, so he was not scared of a local bully like Monkey. He was just mad that they were insulting Philip! “Damn it! Who the f*ck are you? Is it your turn to speak? You’re going to die and you’re still so stubborn.” Monkey looked at Theo from head to toe. “You do look like a human after dressing up, though. Do you believe that I’ll beat you until you kneel and beg me for mercy?” “My name is Theo Zander. Who do you think I am?” Theo replied coldly. When Monkey heard the name, he was shocked at first. Then, he clutched his stomach and guffawed. He swung his steel bat and pointed at Theo arrogantly. “Theo Zander? You look like a p*ssy and you dare to say that you’re Theo Zander?</p> <p id = > Do you know who Theo Zander is? He’s my boss’ boss! He’s the underground king of Riverdale!” Monkey could not hold back his laughter.</p>  <p id = > He did not expect to run into an idiot like this fella today. “Hey, dumb*ass! Look at yourself in the mirror before telling others that you’re Theo Zander.</p>  <p id = > How dare you pretend to be Theo? If you’re really Theo Zander, then I’m your grandson!” “What big words! You’re digging your own grave!” Theo’s face fell as he took the first step to kick Monkey on the stomach. Monkey did not expect him to make the first move, so he suffered the kick and staggered a few meters backward before stabling himself. He felt pain spreading across his stomach. Monkey rubbed his stomach through gritted teeth and yelled angrily, “Why the f*ck are y’all still standing here? Go!</p>  <p id = > Cripple all of them! Cripple Philip Clarke first! Strip that woman and take her back!” In an instant, a group of people charged toward them while swinging their weapons. In the end, Theo and his three men defeated all of these thugs in less than five minutes. They were all writhing on the ground in pain. Philip took the opportunity and kicked them a few times. He was adding to their pain. The rest of them were all taken care of by Theo and his men. Of course, the reason Theo could be where he was today was because of his skills. He had handpicked all of his men, so naturally, Monkey and</p>  <p id = > the local bullies were not worthy to be their opponents. “Tell me! Who ordered you to do this?” Theo stepped on Monkey’s face and did not show any mercy at all. Monkey started to shriek loudly from the pain. “F*ck you!</p>  <p id = > I’m one of Ned’s men! If you dare to touch me, Ned will not forgive you!” Monkey was stubborn. Rage was burning in his eyes. “Ned Sutherland?”</p>  <p id = > Theo snorted and continued to say, “He won’t dare to speak to me that way even if he’s standing in front of me.” “Stop f*cking pretending! When he gets here, I’m sure you’ll suffer the consequences of your actions! If you know what’s best for you, you’ll let me go!” Monkey kept on hurling abuses. He was seething. Theo then kicked him in the face and his nose started bleeding profusely. However... When Monkey was about to hurl</p> <p id = > more abuses, four Range Rovers sped over and stopped abruptly at the side of the road. In a blink of an eye, a man who was about six feet two got out of the car. He was huge and appeared to be covered in muscles. He looked extremely strong. Seven to eight men got out of the cars behind him. That muscular man scanned the scene quickly. His eyes were terrifying. “Ned?”</p>  <p id = > When he saw the man, it was as if Monkey had seen hope. He yelled happily,</p>  <p id = > “Ned! Over here! Save me, Ned!” Ned’s eyes were on Monkey who was on the floor. He was being held firmly to the ground by Theo’s foot. However, Ned chose to ignore him. Under everyone’s shocked gazes, Ned walked over to Theo and did a 90-degree bow. He said, “Theo! I’ve brought my men here. What do you want me to do?” Theo’s expression was neutral. He nodded calmly. “Theo?” At this moment, it was as if Monkey had a spell cast on him. His eyes went wide and his jaw dropped open. He could not believe what he was seeing or hearing. Monkey was beyond confused, especially when he saw Ned standing next to Theo humbly. He felt like his view of the world was all wrong. He hated himself. He was remorseful! His back started to be drenched in cold sweat. Even an idiot would be able to understand what was going on at this moment. The person in front of him was indeed the underground king of Riverdale, Theo Zander! The myth, the legend, the boss of his boss—Theo Zander! Monkey had been begging Ned</p>  <p id = > to bring him to visit Theo, but he still lacked the qualifications. He did not think the day he finally met Theo would be under these circumstances! Was God playing a joke on him? He was done for!</p>  <h2 id =chapter-206 > Chapter 206</h2>  <p id = > Monkey’s face went pale. His face was ashy, and he was extremely frantic.</p>  <p id = > When he was at a complete loss and was thinking about how to turn the situation around, the underground king of Riverdale walked humbly to another young man and bowed. He asked, “Mr. Clarke, what do you think we should do to them?” Mr. Clarke? Damn it! Was that young man Philip Clarke? The man that Eric wanted him to cripple? When he saw this, Monkey was in a complete state of shock. It was as if his heart had stopped beating. ‘Eric Yates, you’re killing me!’ In Monkey’s eyes, Theo was someone he had to maintain a respectful distance from. He was involved with both the dark and light sides. He had huge power over a lot of things.</p>  <p id = > If he stomped his foot, the entire Riverdale would shake! Now, this person was being so respectful toward that young man. He was also acting extremely cautious around him. He could guess the identity of that young man just from the way Theo was treating him. He wanted so badly to die now! As he watched the young man approach him, Monkey’s heart leaped into his throat. “Did Eric ask you to do this?” Philip asked coldly. Monkey hesitated before nodding quickly. He admitted to everything. “Yes! Eric asked me to do this. Please, Sir, please forgive me. I was blind. I was a fool.</p>  <p id = > I deserve to die! This has nothing to do with me. I was just looking to make ends meet. Please forgive me, Sir!” Philip frowned and scratched his chin.</p>  <p id = > He looked like he was in deep thought. Then, he said, “What did you say to insult my wife just now?” Monkey started sobbing as he said, “I deserve to die! I deserve to die a thousand deaths! I was wrong, Sir! Please forgive me.</p>  <p id = > I will be willing to undergo the most severe trials for you if you let me go!</p>  <p id = > I’ll listen to everything you say, Sir!” While he said that, Monkey got up from the ground and slapped himself on the face again and again. He slapped himself until he started to bleed. If he did not do that, he knew he</p> <p id = > would die an even more horrible death. Philip pondered and said, “Alright, I’ll give you another chance. Watch the Yates for me. Report everything they do to me.” “Alright!” Monkey agreed quickly. “Right, find an opportunity to return a gift to Eric for me. You should know what to do, right?” Philip chuckled coldly. Monkey trembled and agreed. He knelt on the ground and started kowtowing. He said, “I understand! Don’t worry, Mr. Clarke. I understand completely! I will do this well!” After he said that, Philip and Theo got into the car and left. This interruption was nothing to them. Philip only thought about asking Monkey to watch the Yates at the very last minute. The reason was that he was unhappy with the Yates family. He was wondering if he should take action against them. Never mind. He should just let it be. If Eric decided to do anything, Philip would not mind to wipe out the Yates in one night. They got back to the city. They had been sitting in the car the entire day. Philip brought Wynn back to rest before going to the hospital to see Mila. The next day, Philip wandered around in his company. Then, he invested 30 million and asked Agnes to take care of it.</p>  <p id = > Gopher Delivery Services was responsible for half of the delivery services in Riverdale. He had no choice. It was too f*cking cool to be sending deliveries with BMW bikes! After he got out of his office, Philip thought for a while and decided to go for a candlelit dinner. He chose a French restaurant. When he entered the restaurant, he heard a voice from not far away. “Philip? Why are you here?” He lifted his head and saw two women walking over to him while holding hands. One of them was taller than the</p>  <p id = > other. He knew them. To be more precise, they were his old classmates!</p>  <p id = > “Yolanda?” Philip asked curiously. “Oh, it is you. I didn’t expect to run into you here.” Yolanda was the famous beauty queen in university. She was also extremely flirtatious. She was tall and slender with features as beautiful.</p>  <p id = > She had an amazing body, and she had the potential to be on the cover of Japanese magazines. When she saw Philip, she was taken aback. Then, her face was filled with mockery and sarcasm. Philip had gone after her back when they were in university. However, he did not succeed. Yolanda was not interested in him. She liked men with money. She would rather cry in a</p> <p id = > BMW than laugh on a stupid bicycle. “Yeah, long time no see,” Philip smiled lightly and said. He did not want to pay too much attention to her.</p>  <p id = > There was a misunderstanding between him and Yolanda. When they were in university, he had asked Yolanda to deliver his love letter to Wynn.</p>  <p id = > However, there was a huge misunderstanding in the process and Yolanda thought he had feelings for her. “Why? Where’s your wife, Wynn? She didn’t come with you?” Yolanda chuckled. She turned her head to look for Wynn. “Yola, who is he? He looks so unsophisticated. How do you know someone like this?” The shorter woman next to Yolanda jeered. She did not even try to hide her disgust for Philip.</p>  <h2 id =chapter-207 > Chapter 207</h2>  <p id = > Philip frowned. This little girl was so rude. She was criticizing someone the moment she met them. ‘If I were your father, I would have slapped you!’</p>  <p id = > “Oh, Philip. This is my best friend, Sadie Cash,” Yolanda smiled and said.</p>  <p id = > There was disdain on her face. Philip was such a pervert. What was he looking at? He was staring at her the entire time. Sadie pressed her lips together and scolded fiercely, “What are you looking at? Have you never seen a pretty girl before?” Philip shook his head helplessly and chuckled.</p>  <p id = > He ignored the two of them. Yolanda was not satisfied. She finally ran into the man who had feelings for her when they were back in university. She had to show off! A brilliant woman like Wynn actually married a spineless</p>  <p id = > bum like Philip. She even heard that Philip had been having it tough these past few years. He even owed people a lot of money and was about to have a divorce. Yolanda was feeling pleased. She wanted so badly to show off in front of Philip so that she could insult him a little. Without thinking about the consequences, she pulled Philip into a cafe next door and said, “This is such a rare opportunity. Let’s have a coffee together.” Philip wanted to decline, but he could not. They chose a booth and sat down. After a long while, Yolanda stood up unhappily and said, “Sadie, stay here. I’ll go order coffee.” After she said that, she glared at Philip in detest. This man was not gentlemanly at all. There were two beautiful women here and he did not even do the polite thing by offering to get them coffee. What a loser.</p>  <p id = > Yolanda was glad that she did not fall for a man like him during their university days. Plus, judging from Philip’s outfit, he must be poor. After the few of them chatted for a while, Agnes walked in from the door and said something to Philip. Yolanda and Sadie were curious when they saw a beautiful woman walking over and talking to Philip. “Philip, who is she?”</p>  <p id = > Yolanda asked curiously. Was that Philip’s mistress? No way! How could someone like him get such a beautiful woman? Philip pondered for a while</p> <p id = > and replied calmly, “She’s the manager of my company.” Agnes nodded and smiled at the two of them.”Hello, my name is Agnes Summer. I’m the manager of Philip’s company.” Damn it! Sadie was excited. Her eyes were twinkling when she looked at Philip. She exclaimed, “Philip, you have your own company? Not bad!” How would Sadie not be excited? Philip looked so ordinary, but he had his own company. He must be loaded. This meant that all she needed to do was seduce him a little. She was confident that this stupid man would fall head over heels for her. After all, he had already liked her once before. While imagining that, Sadie took her bag impatiently and announced that she wanted to go to the restroom. Actually, she was going to touch up her makeup. Yolanda was shocked. She asked emotionally,</p>  <p id = > “Philip, do you really have your own company now?” Yolanda was curious. She was not about to make a fuss about nothing like Sadie. After all, she was Philip’s classmate, so she knew about his past. He was just a poor loser. How would he be the boss of a company? Was this a misunderstanding?</p>  <p id = > Even though she was feeling suspicious, Yolanda was doing a good job of keeping her composure. She smiled and said, “Not bad, Philip. I haven’t seen you for three years and you’re doing so well. You even have your own company.” Philip smiled flatly and did not say anything. He knew if he said that he was just an employee, he would definitely be the recipient of Yolanda’s jeers and insults. If that was the case, he would just tell her the truth. He would not have much contact with her in the future anyway, so whatever. Yolanda smiled and said, “I guess Oliver got the wrong information. I thought you weren’t doing so well. I didn’t expect you to be excelling.” Sadie came back at this moment. A woman indeed looked better after she put on some makeup. She was smiling flirtatiously and even winked at Philip repeatedly. She said, “Hey handsome, take us for a tour in your company if you have the time. I have nothing going on recently, so you can ask me out if you want to.” How straightforward! Philip was terrified.</p> <p id = > Yolanda chuckled and said quickly, “Philip, you were absent for the last two gatherings. This time, you have to come no matter what. Coincidentally, they’ve booked a private room at Arc de Triumph Hotel today. You can’t run away again!” Philip was shocked. “Today?” Yolanda nodded. She said,</p>  <p id = > “Yeah, didn’t Oliver tell you?” Philip had received the invitation for the previous two gatherings, but he declined both of them. Back then, he and Wynn were having conflicts. Plus, it would be awkward for him to attend when he was a nobody. Perhaps it was because he had already declined them twice that Oliver Jurgen did not invite Philip this time. This was so unexpected.</p>  <h2 id =chapter-208 > Chapter 208</h2>  <p id = > Yolanda watched as Philip hesitated. She said quickly, “Since we’re all here, let’s go together. We haven’t seen each other in so many years.” Actually, Yolanda wanted to get close to Philip through this gathering. She felt</p>  <p id = > remorseful for not having any interest in Philip back then. She did not expect a man like him to have such potential. Philip touched his nose and nodded his head. “Alright.” Philip did not have anything to do in the afternoon anyway. Also, his candlelit dinner reservation with Wynn was for tomorrow. As such, he did not have to worry. Philip told Agnes something before the latter went back to the office. After staying a while longer at the cafe, Yolanda and Sadie brought Philip to the karaoke in the mall nearby.</p>  <p id = > “Oliver and the gang will be singing here before going to Arc de Triumph,”</p>  <p id = > said Yolanda. She even grabbed Philip’s arm voluntarily and said in a mysterious tone, “Philip, do you know what Joshua opened a company of his own as well? His turnover is already at three million bucks. I heard he’s going to hit a target of 20 million this year! He’s the one who’s hosting this gathering today.” Philip did not like Yolanda holding him like this. He knew what this woman had in her mind. He removed Yolanda’s hand from his arm politely and shook his head. He said, “Joshua has his own company?</p>  <p id = > We haven't talked in so long.” Yolanda’s expression changed. She did not expect Philip to be so insensible. She made a face as her tone became colder.</p>  <p id = > She crossed her arms across her chest and squeezed her breasts together.</p>  <p id = > She said, “Weren’t you guys best friends back then? What’s wrong? Did you guys fight?” Yolanda knew that Philip and Joshua McAdams used to be best friends back then. They were always seen together. One would call them bosom buddies. Now, they did not even keep in touch anymore. They must have gotten into a fight because of Wynn. Everyone knew that Joshua</p> <p id = > had feelings for Wynn back then. However, in the end, Wynn decided to be with Philip. All the guys who had feelings for Wynn were jealous. It was also because of this that Philip fell out with a lot of his friends. That b*tch was such a femme fatale. At this moment, Sadie came over as well. She was feeling nosey. “Hey, who’s Joshua? What’s this about his company?”</p>  <p id = > Sadie’s head was shaking slightly. She seemed passionate. Philip shook his head and said, “I don’t know. I stopped talking to him after graduation.”</p>  <p id = > Yolanda gave a knowing nod and did not say anything more. “Oh, right, are</p>  <p id = > you still in contact with Juan Parker? Howard Lowe too. Oh, and also Carl Ortega! Did you stop talking to all of them?” Yolanda asked curiously.</p>  <p id = > When Sadie heard that, she frowned and complained. “Philip, why does it feel like you have zero contact with your old classmates? You’re so bad at keeping in contact with people!” “I think I’m still alright. I’m not so sure about Juan, but I’m still in contact with Howard. Actually, I don’t really like to keep in touch with everyone. It’s enough for me to have a few close friends,” Philip said. Philip felt a little sad when he thought about Juan. He had not seen Howard in so long. He wondered about his wedding arrangements with Ruby. Philip had yet to tell Howard about catching Ruby in the act at the hotel last time. He was worried that Howard would be sad if he told him. He was even more scared that Howard would not believe him. They might stop being friends because of this. The three of them walked together and arrived at the private room after a short while. They could hear shrieks and screams from inside the room. However, in a short while, they could hear all kinds of praises and compliments. They felt extremely awkward while listening to these noises outside of the room.</p>  <p id = > “Haha! How amazing, Mr. McAdams! You sounded just like the original soundtrack! I’m blown away by your talents!” “Exactly! Mr. McAdam should participate in The Voice! With his voice, he’ll definitely be the winner!” “Not only is Mr. McAdams rich and extremely talented, but he is also a hottie! He’s tall, rich, and handsome!” … The crowd was praising him respectfully. Philip felt awkward hearing those remarks. He could only chuckle to himself. Yolanda pushed the door open and went in. She announced to the room, “Everybody, come see who I stumbled into today!”</p> <p id = > The room fell silent immediately. Under the colorful lights, everyone’s eyes were glued on the person behind Yolanda. Coldness. Silence. No one was cheering. Only a few people shouted with a fake smile, “F*ck me! Philip Clarke is here!” “He’s such a busy man! I haven’t seen him in three years and I finally get to see him here!” “Philip, you son of a b*tch. If you’re doing badly, you should just tell us. We’ll definitely give you a hand so that</p>  <p id = > you won’t have to dress like that!” Laughter and nasty comments started to sound in the room.</p>  <h2 id =chapter-209 > Chapter 209</h2>  <p id = > There were all kinds of cold stares and jeers. This was the so-called gathering. Eventually, it would become a place for flattery and sneers. This was also why Philip did not want to come. What kind of gathering was this?</p>  <p id = > It was all fake. The ex-classmates here were all swinging with each other.</p>  <p id = > In addition to that, the men always tried to curry favors and be posers.</p>  <p id = > “Philip, why didn’t you tell me that you were coming? I could’ve gone to pick you up. What’s wrong? You didn’t come the first two times I asked you but you’re here now when Yolanda’s the one inviting you. Are you trying to disrespect me?” Joshua was the one who said that. He stood up and walked over. He placed his arm around Philip’s shoulder and pretended to be cordial. Philip looked at him coldly. Had he become so hypocritical now?</p>  <p id = > When did he invite him? Was it not Oliver the one who invited him the previous two times? After walking to the middle of the room, Joshua gave Philip a glass of wine. He said, “Come, it’s such a rare chance for us to see Philip. Let’s give him a toast. This was the most popular guy in our school back then!” Everyone was feeling indifferent about Philip. They heard that he was not doing so well all these years. He was not as dazzling as he was before. However, since Joshua had already said that, they all lifted their glasses as they wanted to flatter Joshua. Philip chuckled coldly and drank his wine. Then, he sat down at a corner. However, it was obvious that Joshua would not let go of this rare opportunity. He hinted at Carl who was sitting at one side and the latter immediately got it. He said loudly, “Say, Philip, you son of a b*tch. Where have you been all these years? You don’t even pick up your phone. Did you change your number? You didn’t come to the gathering when Oliver invited you. Are you not bothered about your old classmates anymore?” Carl knew what Joshua wanted. He wanted him to humiliate Philip, or rather, to shame him. When he said that, everyone</p> <p id = > started berating Philip. “Yeah, Philip. Are you rich now? Is that why you’re not interested in us anymore?” “How can he be rich? I knew he was just playing to the gallery back when we were in university. He has no genuine talent at all!” “Hehe, Carl, stop making fun of Philip. Who here in this crowd is better than Mr. McAdams?” Everyone continued to belittle Philip, but at the same time, they did not forget to flatter Joshua. Joshua sat at his seat while feeling pleased. He lifted his hand and said, “Hey, you guys speak too highly of me. It’s just a small company.” However, the smirk on his face betrayed the pride inside his heart. When he saw Philip sitting at the corner all by himself, Joshua felt extremely pleased. Back then, Philip was the star while they were all side characters. Who knew that every dog would have its day. Today, he became the star. He was pleased with himself. He felt extremely proud! “Hey, Philip, I’m asking you a question. Why aren’t you answering me? Why are you so arrogant?” Carl was slightly frustrated as he asked coldly. This idiot was sitting there unperturbed. Was he looking down on him? Philip chuckled and said, “It’s nothing. I’ve been really busy these few years, so I didn’t have time. I apologize to everyone here. Plus, I’m here today, aren’t I?” Philip was clear about what these people were thinking. He knew how to play these cheap tricks since he was as young as eight years old. Joshua guffawed and said, “Alright! It’s difficult for all of us to gather here. We should drink to this!” After downing his wine, Joshua started causing trouble. He asked, “Philip, I heard you started a business after you graduated. How’s it? It’s doing well, right?” Philip shook his head and said,</p>  <p id = > “I failed.” Carl laughed sarcastically and said, “So what? It’s fine. You’re not made to start businesses anyway. Right, how are you and Wynn? I heard you’re planning to get a divorce.” Everyone in the room fell silent after they heard that. They lifted their ears. Wynn Johnston. It was such a dreamy name. She used to be the girl of everyone’s dreams back in university. They did not expect her to marry a spineless coward like Philip. Joshua’s face fell.</p>  <p id = > He was watching Philip’s every move. “Don’t worry, we’re doing great,” Philip said and smiled. Carl chuckled perfunctorily. Joshua said quickly,</p> <p id = > “Why didn’t you bring her? She was the campus belle. Are you worried about her? Is that why you didn’t bring her here?” Joshua wanted to see Wynn. He wanted to prove to her that her decision was wrong. He was even more successful than Philip now. After being quiet for a while, Philip said,</p>  <p id = > “She’s busy, so she doesn’t have the time.” Everyone looked at each other and laughed. They were all looking at Philip like they were poking fun at him. This guy was such a poser. He should just admit that they were going through a divorce! What could not be said among friends? Joshua got up and sat next to Philip. He patted him on the shoulder and said, “I hired someone to find out about this. You’re working as a delivery guy now? Why are you doing so badly now?” It was here. The main question was here!</p>  <p id = > Philip lifted his eyebrow. He said, “Yeah, it’s to make a living. There’s nothing bad about working as a delivery guy. I’m not like you guys. You’re all bosses or managers. I’m so envious.” Since Joshua wanted to feel superior to him, he would just give it to him. He did not lack that anyway.</p>  <p id = > Plus, it was meaningless. Joshua faked a smile and said, “It’s fine. Being a delivery man is a good job. I heard you can earn more than 10,000 bucks a month if you work hard.” Philip shrugged. “I guess. I’m just trying to make ends meet.” When Carl heard this, he laughed and said, “Philip, Joshua just started a new company and he’s hiring. Why don’t you consider it? Just tell Josh, I’m sure he won’t treat you badly.” Joshua smiled toothily and sat there unperturbed. He sipped on his wine and waited for Philip to beg him.</p>  <p id = > How wonderful! He never expected the day that Philip would come to beg him.</p>  <h2 id =chapter-210 > Chapter 210</h2>  <p id = > “Yeah, Philip. This is such a rare chance. I want to go too. Josh, what about me?” One of Philip’s classmates said in envy. “Me too. I heard the current account of Josh’s company has a few million every month. He has so many employees too!” Yolanda was envious. Her face was filled with adoration.</p>  <p id = > She sat close to Joshua and kept acting coquettishly. There were more than</p>  <p id = > ten people in the room. Initially, everyone was just doing their own things.</p>  <p id = > However, when they heard Carl’s conversation, everyone became eager and was looking at Joshua with impatient gazes. It became obvious now that they had just come to the gathering for their own selfish needs. It could not be helped. This was the reality of it. They were all normal people. They just wanted an easy way out. This was understandable. It was not despicable.</p>  <p id = > “Mr. McAdams, do you still need people?” “Josh, what about me? I was a secretary before. I can do anything.” “...” Sadie, who was sitting at one side, immediately got close to Joshua. Her eyes were twinkling. This was a goldmine! She was the one who begged Yolanda to bring her here. Her goal was to curry favors with a rich man like Joshua. She would do anything for money. Everyone started chattering non-stop. They wanted to show that they had what it took to be hired by Joshua. Joshua smiled and said, “My company is still new, and I’m indeed hiring. However, I just need two. If you want to come, please send your resumes to my email. As for my old classmates, I will definitely take good care of you all.” Joshua was feeling extremely pleased when he heard them praising and complimenting him.</p>  <p id = > However, he would not get over his own head. He could not give each one of them a job just because they were his old classmates. He still had to see what they got. If not, his company would be at risk. “Philip, don’t even think about it. How much money can your delivery company make in a month?</p> <p id = > Hurry up and beg Josh. He might hire you if you make him happy. I heard the starting salary is at least 7,000 bucks,” said Carl in envy. When he said that, everyone fell into a state of shock again. It was just a new company and its starting salary for employees was 7,000 bucks?! What about in the future then? In a blink of an eye, everyone’s eyes started burning with flames of passion. Two vacancies were not enough! “Hey, don’t listen to him. The starting pay isn’t 7,000 bucks. It’s only 5,000. But I will also reward my employees based on performance. What do you think, Philip? If you need money, you can work for me. I’ll reserve a slot for you. For Wynn’s sake, I won’t treat you unfairly. When the time comes, you and</p>  <p id = > Wynn can just treat me to a meal.” Joshua smiled. He had a pleased expression on his face. Now, in Joshua’s eyes, he and Philip were people from different levels. Philip was just a delivery guy. He was working a low-level job. Joshua was not interested in him at all. He was just exchanging courtesies with him. It would all depend on Joshua’s mood whether he wanted to hire him or not. As long as Philip took this opportunity, he would be able to use this chance to get close to Wynn. He had not seen her for so many years. Joshua wondered how Wynn was doing. “Thank you. I’ll think about it.” Philip smiled. “Think about it? Philip, don’t miss this chance. This is a rare opportunity. Mr. McAdams is opening the backdoor for you and you still want to think about it?” Yolanda was eyeing Philip furiously. Was this guy an idiot? Joshua was personally offering him the chance to work at his company and Philip still wanted to think about it. He did not know what was good for him! As for Philip’s company, Yolanda had already forgotten about it. She did not believe a guy like him would be capable of starting a company. It might just be a lie so that he would not make a fool of himself in front of her. Everyone started criticizing Philip in frustration. “Philip, you don’t know what’s good for you. This is a chance given to you by Mr.</p>  <p id = > McAdams!” “This idiot still wants to think about it. He doesn’t know how to appreciate favors!” “A piece of trash will always be a piece of trash. No wonder Wynn wants to divorce him. He doesn’t even know how to grasp a golden opportunity.” Philip was faced with everyone’s criticisms. Philip was feeling helpless. He thought for a while and said, “Um, everyone, actually I don’t need the help because I’m…”</p>  <h2 id =chapter-211 > Chapter 211</h2>  <p id = > “What? What is it? Do you want to say that you’re loaded?” Sadie talked back in frustration. This guy was disrespecting Joshua. There was a small smile on Joshua’s face. However, the dissatisfaction in his heart was getting more and more intense. ‘I gave you a chance and you’re not appreciating it.</p>  <p id = > Not only that, but you still want to decline? ‘How dare you reject me with your current status?’ He was still a piece of trash at the end of the day!</p>  <p id = > “Philip, I should advise you to think about this clearly. Go back and discuss it with Wynn. If you need any help, just come find me at my office. I’ll definitely lend you a hand.” Joshua clapped his hands together and took out a name card from his pocket. He threw it over to Philip rudely like he was giving alms. “Alright, I think that’s enough fun. Let’s go eat at Arc de Triumph.” Joshua smiled and ignored Philip’s unappreciative expression.</p>  <p id = > Everyone stood up, giving dirty looks at Philip. This idiot was such a fool.</p>  <p id = > He did not even know how to appreciate such a rare opportunity. He was going to be a loser forever, so they decided to stay away from Philip.</p>  <p id = > Everyone was thinking about the same thing. Philip felt helpless. He was the last to get up and follow them. ‘I’m the heir of a billionaire. Why won’t you let me finish?’ He got out and walked to the parking lot. Joshua drove out with his stylish Audi R8. This car was expensive. It cost around one to two million bucks. When he drove out, he caught the eyes of a lot of people.</p>  <p id = > It was so cool! Yolanda, Sadie, and a few female classmates were all staring.</p>  <p id = > However, this car could only fit two people. The women would definitely fight to sit on the passenger seat. Joshua knew what these women were thinking. He smiled and asked, “Who wants to ride with me?” “Me!” “Me, me, me!” In a blink of an eye, a few women rushed over to the passenger</p> <p id = > seat impatiently. Some even started to fight. In the end, Joshua looked at Yolanda and said, “Yolanda, get in. I’ll drive you.” Yolanda was feeling gleeful. She walked over with her high heels clacking against the floor. She twisted her bottom and sat inside the car. The women were all looking at her with envy and jealousy. Then, Joshua laughed and said, “Um, I’ll be heading over now. Please take care of each other if you have cars.” After a while, a few classmates started to drive out of the parking lot with their cars.</p>  <p id = > The best one was a BMW 3 Series. It belonged to Carl, and he was taking three women. He was also feeling pleased with himself. Then, out came the more normal cars like Volkswagen Phaeton and Buick. Philip was the only one standing at the side of the road. No one wanted to give him a ride. Joshua</p>  <p id = > was still inside his car when he saw Philip. He had a fake smile on his face.</p>  <p id = > He said, “Philip, you didn’t drive here?” “How will he have a car? He must have walked over! Never mind, let’s just ignore him, Josh. We should head over first. We’ll just let him use the e-hailing service,” Yolanda said in contempt. She could not wait to experience the Audi R8. “Haha, Philip, you haven’t bought a car yet?” “How useless! You’ve graduated for three years and you still can’t afford a car?” “Sigh, we’re not on the same level after all.</p>  <p id = > Life is full of ups and downs.” Everyone started to make fun of him. Joshua pondered for a while and nodded. He took out a 100 dollar bill and threw it at Philip like he was giving money to a beggar. He said, “It’s for you to call a cab. I’m treating everyone here, so I can’t let you spend a dime.” After he said that, he drove his car away abruptly with a loud rumbling noise. Then, the other cars followed suit. The street was filled with their laughter and nasty remarks. Philip was fine with this. He did not want to quibble over the need to buy a car. When he was about to call a cab, he heard a deep masculine voice behind him. “You’re here as well, Mr. Clarke?” When he heard that, he turned around and saw Tiger’s huge body almost knocking into his. Fortunately, he stopped just in time and stood in front of Philip humbly. He smiled and scratched his head before saying, “What a coincidence, Mr. Clarke.” “Yeah.” Philip nodded and did not say anything.</p> <p id = > Tiger was feeling anxious. Mr. Clarke did not bicker with him about what had happened last time. However, he still felt very apologetic and wanted to find a chance to make it up to him. He did not expect to run into Mr. Clarke today. “Did you drive here?” Philip asked suddenly. When Tiger heard this, he smiled flatteringly and said, “I did. Where are you going, Mr. Clark? I’ll drive you there myself.” Then, Tiger led Philip into the parking lot. At the same time, Ruby was holding a middle-aged man’s arms in front of the cafe.</p>  <p id = > They were about to go inside. She saw the backs of the two men from the corner of her eyes. How familiar. ‘Why does that man look like Philip?’</p>  <p id = > Ruby was curious. The other man’s back too! It looked so muscular, like Tiger’s! Philip and Tiger together? Was she overthinking? Ruby shook her</p>  <p id = > head and continued to rub herself against the middle-aged man sweetly.</p>  <p id = > They entered the cafe, and she did not think about this anymore. Tiger led Philip into the parking lot. He opened the car door, but Philip did not get in.</p>  <p id = > “Holy cow! You look like a brick wall and you’re driving a pink Porsche 911?” Philip was stunned. A feminine pink Porsche 911 was right there in front of his eyes. Tiger blushed. He was feeling awkward, so he explained immediately, “You’re mistaken, Mr. Clarke. This car belongs to Theo’s daughter. I drove it out to take care of some business.” Theo’s daughter? He did not think he had met her before. Actually, Tiger omitted something.</p>  <p id = > When they were buying the car, Melody Zander asked for his opinion. Tiger felt that the pink one looked the best. Who said that a man with a large build could not have the heart of a teenage girl?</p>  <h2 id =chapter-212 > Chapter 212</h2>  <p id = > Philip was feeling helpless, but eventually, he still got in. In a blink of an eye, the two of them arrived at Arc de Triumph. Tiger parked the car in the parking lot, and Philip got out. After a few steps, he ran into Joshua. He and Yolanda had gotten there first. When Joshua saw that Philip was here, he was curious. His Audi R8 was not slow. The rest were not here yet but Philip was already here? “Hey, Philip. I didn’t think you would manage to get a cab that quickly. Did you take a shortcut?” Joshua smiled mockingly. At the same time, he looked behind Philip. A pink Porsche 911. It seemed that Philip had gotten out of that car just now. Was it possible? He must be seeing things Yolanda chimed in and said sarcastically, “You ran over here, didn’t you? He was the champion of the 5,000-meter run back then.” Joshua chuckled. Philip did not say anything. The two of them turned around and walked in. Tiger ran over a short while later. He said something to Philip before turning around to leave. At the same time, the rest of Philip’s classmates arrived. “Philip? You got here first?” A few people asked curiously when they saw Philip standing by the door. This guy did not have a car, though. How did he manage to get here faster than the ones with cars?</p>  <p id = > How weird! Philip chuckled and said, “The driver took a shortcut.” When they heard that, they understood. Sadie could not control herself and said,</p>  <p id = > “What driver? You just called a cab. You’re even calling the DiDi driver your driver now? Will you die if you stop being ostentatious?” Sadie was no longer trying to curry favors with Philip as she was before. When she was in the car, she heard that Philip was a complete loser. What company?</p>  <p id = > It was all fake! It must be fake. Sadie told this to some other people and they all agreed that Philip did not want to humiliate himself in front of Yolanda, so he purposely made up a lie. They all shook their heads and laughed in disdain. Then, they turned their heads and left. Philip just smiled. This gathering was so boring. They were all just trying to feel superior. In a few seconds, they were all sitting in the private room. Arc de Triumph was an expensive and famous hotel. The people who could afford</p> <p id = > to sit here were all rich people. A lot of Philip’s old classmates had never come here before.</p>  <p id = > This time, they were all looking around with awe on their faces. On any normal occasion, everyone would sit randomly during a gathering.</p>  <p id = > However, today was different. Everyone was cautious and kept on flattering Joshua so that he would sit on the main seat. It was only after he sat down did everyone finally dare to take a seat. Philip had been forgotten a long time ago. He found a random spot and sat down there. No one said anything.</p>  <p id = > After all, they understood. No one would want to flatter a person with no status like Philip. After he sat down, Joshua snapped his finger and called the server over. He said, “Three bottles of Romanee-Contis and two bottles of Maotai.” In a blink of an eye, the server came over with the alcohol.</p>  <p id = > “Wow! Romanee-Conti! A bottle of this costs 10,000 bucks!” “Holy moly!</p>  <p id = > You’re amazing, Mr. McAdams! You can indeed be imposing when you’re rich!” “I don’t care! I want to work with Mr. McAdams in the future!” The crowd was excited, and their gazes were heated. Joshua smiled and shook his hand. He said, “It’s nothing, really. It’s just a few bottles of alcohol. You guys should know that as someone with their own business, we have to know something about alcohol because we need to have dealings with</p>  <p id = > clients. 10,000 bucks for Romanee-Conti is nothing.” When Yolanda heard this, her eyes went wide. Joshua had feelings for her back then. During their university days, she was young and did not understand men, so she rejected him. Today, she was feeling extremely remorseful. She was thinking of ways to claim relations with Joshua. Subconsciously, she looked at Philip.</p>  <p id = > The differences between them were too huge. Suddenly, she remembered Philip saying that he had his own company as well. However, Yolanda did not think that it was true. She started to look down on Philip even more. At the same time, the door of the room was opened. Zayn walked in holding a few bottles of top-tier alcohol in his hands. He smiled and said, “Everyone, I’m the manager of this restaurant, and this is the latest red wine we have.</p> <p id = > They are from Château Pétrus.” Everyone was shocked. They did not understand what was going on. Joshua jumped up from shock. He knew about the red wine from Château Pétrus. One bottle would cost more than 10,000 bucks. It was about the same level as Romanee-Conti. However, he did not order these! Even if Joshua was rich, he would not waste his money like this. “I’m sorry, we didn’t order these,” Joshua said with a smile. Carl, who was sitting next to him, started explaining to everyone. The crowd knew immediately that one bottle of this wine cost more than 10,000 bucks!</p>  <p id = > “Oh, these are gifts from us.” Zayn smiled. His eyes landed on Philip secretly as he nodded slightly. Everyone was stunned. Gifts? Holy moly!</p>  <p id = > Was Joshua such an important person? The manager of Arc de Triumph was gifting them wine himself! However, Joshua did not think this was the case.</p>  <p id = > His face fell as he frowned. He did not know this Mr. Yeager. “Excuse me, Mr. Yeager, why are you giving us wine?” Joshua asked. Zayn peered at Philip and smiled. He said, “It’s because of Mr…”</p>  <h2 id =chapter-213 > Chapter 213</h2>  <p id = > Before Zayn could finish talking, he met Philip’s cold gaze. He changed what he was about to say immediately. “It’s fine. Enjoy.” All kinds of discussions broke out in the private room. They were all wondering who</p>  <p id = > was the one so capable that even the manager of Arch de Triumph personally gifted them bottles of expensive wine. “Who? Who among you knows Mr. Yeager?” A bottle of this wine cost more than 10,000 bucks and they were gifted with three bottles. Everyone looked at each other, guessing who the VIP could be. Of course, no one looked at Philip. Who was he to be considered? Zayn and Philip communicated with each other with their eyes. Thankfully, he was quick. If he exposed Mr. Clarke’s identity, he could just get out of Arc de Triumph. Just now, when Zayn was in the manager’s office, the receptionist ran in and told him Mr. Clarke was here.</p>  <p id = > He ran downstairs immediately and chose a few good wines to make Mr.</p>  <p id = > Clarke happy. He wanted to perform well in front of him. He did not expect this to backfire. Zayn was clever. He exited the room when he saw everyone suspecting each other. “Wow! Who is the VIP? Take a picture and post it to WeChat moment! This is red wine from Château Pétrus! Normal people will never be able to drink this!” A few women were squirming in their seats in excitement. They took out their phones and started snapping pictures furiously. “Haha, I think Mr. Yeager must have sent these over himself because he saw Mr. McAdams,” Carl said with a grin on his face. When everyone heard that, they nodded their heads in agreement. “Yeah, I think only Mr. McAdams has the prestige and reputation for this.” “Josh, why didn’t you tell us that you know the manager of Arc de Triumph? Is this a surprise for all of us?” “Mr. McAdams, you son of a gun! How generous!”</p>  <p id = > The crowd started to rain praises down on him. Joshua was puzzled. He did not know the manager of Arc de Triumph. However, it was impossible for him to stop them now. He smiled and said, “Haha, it’s nothing. The most important thing is that you guys are happy. If it’s not enough, I’ll ask Zayn</p> <p id = > to bring more.” A dead mouse would not feel cold. He had already put on an act, so he did not mind to go even further. When everyone heard that, they cheered, “Hooray, Mr. McAdams! I’ll definitely stick to you from now on.” Yolanda’s brain was occupied with Joshua. The more she looked at him, the more good looking he became to her. She wanted so badly to</p>  <p id = > swallow him whole. She had to get this man. She went to the restroom and removed her bra. This would make what she was about to do much easier.</p>  <p id = > When she went back to the room, she sat down next to Joshua. She ran her foot up Joshua’s leg unintentionally and touched him with her hands. The other party could not handle her teasing anymore. As an experienced man who frequented nightclubs, Joshua just needed to take one glance before he knew that Yolanda was not wearing a bra. He chuckled and clinked his glass with Yolanda. The two of them were touching hands and feet under the table. They were in an extremely amorous state. Yolanda said just in time,</p>  <p id = > “Philip, what’s your company called? How much do you make in a year?</p>  <p id = > Why don’t you shut it down and work for Mr. McAdams instead?” She was looking down on Philip. He thought he was all that just because he married Wynn? He was still a good-for-nothing. Yolanda was saying this on purpose. In her opinion, even if Philip was that good and started a stupid company, could he make more than Joshua? He had a current account of a few hundred thousand bucks every month. Everyone in the room had their eyes glued on Philip. They were looking at him weirdly. Joshua also looked over with a raised eyebrow. He frowned and asked in disdain, “Philip, you also have your own company? Why didn’t you tell us just now?” Philip replied calmly, “It’s nothing. I can’t compare to you, Mr. McAdams.”</p>  <p id = > Actually, Philip was worried that Joshua and his gang would want to crawl into the ground if he told them. He had just invested 30 million into his company for an expansion like it was nothing. As for his old classmates who were just paying lip service, he felt extremely disgusted by them. After talking for so long, these people still refused to give him a break. They were all mocking and belittling him. Was this the so-called camaraderie among friends? Joshua chuckled and asked with a raised eyebrow, “What</p> <p id = > company? Tell us. I want to see if I’ll have the chance to work with you guys.” This guy can also start his own company? What a joke! Philip answered truthfully, “It’s a delivery service. I just have some performance shares. It’s really nothing. I’m literally an arm-flinging shopkeeper.” Joshua</p>  <p id = > frowned and said, “Is that so? No wonder you’re not interested in us. That’s fine. I’m glad that everyone’s doing well. I hope your business skyrockets and starts having franchises all over the country.” After he said that, he made a toast. Everyone downed their drinks, but they were feeling unhappy. Philip was initially a victim of everyone’s insults. They did not expect him to have his own company. Even if they were performance shares, it was still amazing. It was much better than working for other people.</p>  <h2 id =chapter-214 > Chapter 214</h2>  <p id = > After he sat down, Joshua asked impatiently, “Right, what’s the name of your company? I’ll ask my people to make some inquiries later. We might even have the chance to work together in the future. You can just deliver the lunches for our staff next time.” Philip nodded and answered, “Gopher Delivery Services.” After he said that, everyone fell silent. They were not enthusiastic about this. Everyone was trying their best to curry favors with Joshua. After all, he was the star of today. Philip’s company? It was just something on a small scale. It was nothing compared to Joshua’s business.</p>  <p id = > What future would there be for a delivery company? Philip ate his food quietly. If he knew this was going to happen, he would not have come. He was just watching Joshua being a poser the entire time. It was so boring. The food was almost finished. Joshua and Yolanda went out together. They said they needed to take care of something. Everyone in the room understood what was going on. They were going to have a quickie. All of the men in the room knew this very well. Scenes of the two of them entangled with each other across their heads. When they thought about Yolanda’s hot body, they figured that Joshua had got himself a good deal. Indeed, after more than ten minutes, Joshua walked back into the room with a satisfied grin on his face. Yolanda walked in a few minutes later. Her face was blushing, and there was a slight glow to her cheeks. Her clothes were also wrinkled. Since getting back, they have been glued to each other. No one said anything. They knew what had happened between them. Sadie was the only one who was</p>  <p id = > mad. She did not expect Yolanda to have made such fast progress. After a while, the room started to be filled with smoke. Joshua had a little too much to drink, so he threw the key of his Audi R8 on the table. He said, “I bought this car for a little more than half a year. I don’t want it anymore. Y’all can take it for half the price. I’m going to buy a Ferrari at the end of the year.”</p>  <p id = > “Wow! How prestigious, Mr. McAdams! A Ferrari?” “He’s indeed loaded.</p> <p id = > He’s so willful.” Joshua shook his head and said, “It’s just money. I can make more. Plus, a Ferrari will sure turn heads.” “Amazing, Mr.</p>  <p id = > McAdams!” “Take us for a ride when that happens.” Joshua smiled. “For sure.” Yolanda stared at Joshua heatedly. It looked like she had made the right decision. A Ferrari! One of them costs four to five million! At this moment, someone interrupted. “F*ck me! Look, you guys. There’s a trending topic saying that there’s a delivery company where all its employees use BMW bikes!” the person exclaimed. Joshua was taken aback. He shook his head and said, “They’re just playing to the gallery. This is the usual marketing trick. They’re hyping themselves up to promote their brand. They’ll get more business this way. However, I think this delivery company should adjust their prices. If they lower their prices, they’ll have more customers. “Of course, this might also be BMW’s marketing tricks.”</p>  <p id = > When Joshua was talking big, that person continued, “No, Mr. McAdams.</p>  <p id = > This company really bought 100 BMW bikes!” “How many?” Everyone was shocked. 100 BMW bikes! It must cost at least tens of millions! What rich company was this? At the same time, that person handed his phone over. He pointed the video to Joshua, “Here, there’s a video. It was taken by an employee from a BMW store. They said that the company wants to use BMW bikes so that their delivery speed will be faster.” Everyone gathered around while looking at each other. That company was so darn rich! A few days ago, they saw a few BMW bikes sending deliveries. They did not think much about it because they thought it was a new gimmick. They did not expect this to be the trending topic for today. Yes, correct. It was the first project from Philip’s 30 million investment. He wanted to promote his</p>  <p id = > company. He wanted it to trend! A delivery company? Everyone was puzzled. They turned around to look at Philip. He was the only one in the delivery business in this room. Was it his company? Those were 100 BMW</p>  <p id = > bikes they were talking about! They cost 30 million! Was Philip’s company so rich? Yolanda started to feel restless. The video was slightly shaky as it was taken from a distance. This was the angle of someone who was</p> <p id = > capturing the video in secret. Suddenly! Yolanda covered her mouth and exclaimed, “Look! Why does that man look so similar to Philip?”</p>  <h2 id =chapter-215 > Chapter 215</h2>  <p id = > Immediately, the room fell into an eerie silence. That person looked like Philip? That was a joke, right? Everyone widened their eyes as they stared at the screen. They did not want to miss out on any details. The more they looked at it, the more their hearts fell. These two people looked the f*cking same! Plus, the man in the video’s clothes were also the same as what Philip was wearing today! The room was extremely silent. Everyone lifted their heads and glued their eyes on Philip. However, the latter was playing on his phone, unperturbed. He was chatting with Agnes while arranging some work for the company. Finally, Philip noticed everyone staring at him like he was a ghost. He felt goosebumps rising all over his body. He was confused. “Why are you guys looking at me like that?” Philip put away his phone in confusion. Yolanda could not hold it in anymore. She asked challengingly, “Philip, did you buy 100 BMW bikes for your company?”</p>  <p id = > Philip was stunned for a few seconds. He pondered and said, “100 BMW</p>  <p id = > bikes? Are they expensive? I just wanted to change the vehicles in my company.” “Change… vehicles?” At that moment, everyone inhaled sharply. Was this how people changed vehicles? Those were 100 BMW</p>  <p id = > bikes they were talking about! Joshua’s face fell. He frowned as his mood got worse. He smiled weirdly and said, “Philip, stop lying. You bought 100</p>  <p id = > BMW bikes?” Philip looked at everyone, all of their eyes were wide. They wanted to extract some information from Philip. Philip pretended to think</p>  <p id = > while touching his chin. He said, “Yeah, I bought them. They weren’t that expensive, only 30 million.” Joshua inhaled sharply, his eyes filled with shock. He asked in disbelief, “30 million is not expensive?” “Is it? It’s just 100 BMW bikes. For me, that’s child’s play.” Philip shrugged and looked unbothered. “Damn! Philip, you…” At that moment, everyone was speechless. They did not know what to say. This was such a plot twist. Just now, they were all mocking Philip, but now, the tables had turned. They could not accept this, or rather, they did not want to accept this. The</p> <p id = > atmosphere in the room was suffocating. They had been praising Joshua the entire day and even kissed his feet repeatedly. The reason they did that was so that Joshua would take good care of them. Now, however, it turned out that the person they had been belittling spent 30 million to buy 100 BMW</p>  <p id = > bikes! Who would believe him? Was he that rich? Philip touched his nose and smiled calmly. “Don’t look at me like that. It’s for the development of the company. I just invested 30 million. I bought the trending topic as well.”</p>  <p id = > Everyone started to feel dizzy. Joshua’s eyes twitched. He snorted. “Philip, you’re such a poser. You’re going overboard with your boasting. You’re saying you spent 60 million?” Philip must be lying! This idiot must be saying this on purpose because he could not stand them boycotting him.</p>  <p id = > Joshua was frustrated. He had spent so much time and effort putting on a show today, from the karaoke to the restaurant. At the end of the day, Philip snatched away the spotlight with just a few words? Philip pressed his lips together and said, “Is 60 million a lot? It’s just my pocket money for one day.” … Everyone was speechless. Finally, they understood. Philip was just f*cking lying! “Dang! Philip, you’re so shameless!” “When did you learn to lie? 60 million for your pocket money?” “I regret eating with him so much. How embarrassing.” In the next second, all of his old classmates started talking at once. They were all roasting and scolding Philip. At the same time, Philip got a phone call. He looked at the number and saw that it was from Buffer. “My dear Master Philip, I’m already here. Where are you?</p>  <p id = > I’ll come to find you now.” Philip was shocked. “Buffer, why are you here?</p>  <p id = > Didn’t I tell you to come here after some time?” “Master Philip, I miss you so much. Plus, I have a lot of things to report to you. Let’s meet.” Buffer was at Capital City right now. “Alright, when will you arrive in Riverdale?”</p>  <p id = > Philip got up and left the room. Before he left, the people inside could still hear his voice. “I’m not happy with the one billion investment last time.”</p>  <p id = > Chopsticks fell on the ground. An investment of one billion dollars? Buffer?</p> <p id = > Was that the god of investment, Buffer? Joshua and his gang were beyond shocked. They would rather believe that Philip was purposely putting on an act than believe that he was as rich as he claimed to be. They also did not want to believe that he knew Buffer. Everyone exchanged doubtful gazes at each other.</p>  <h2 id =chapter-216 > Chapter 216</h2>  <p id = > Yolanda crossed her arms and scolded angrily, “I wouldn’t have invited him if I knew that this would happen. I didn’t think that he’s so shameless. What is he talking about? Buffer? If he knows Buffer, then I know Jack Ma!”</p>  <p id = > “Yeah, Philip is such a poser. How disappointing.” A few of them started scolding him to calm the alarm in their hearts. Joshua’s face was glum. His face froze as he chuckled slightly. F*ck! The gathering had been ruined by Philip. How should they f*cking continue this? No one had the mood to eat anymore. Yolanda sat there for a while and pondered. She wanted to see if Philip was really that rich. Yolanda slipped out of the room with an excuse and started wandering around the restaurant. Then, she bumped into a waitress when she was not paying attention. In an instant, six expensive bottles of red wine fell onto the ground. They were all broken into pieces.</p>  <p id = > The waitress was shocked. They were the Lafites that a customer ordered.</p>  <p id = > There were six bottles in total, so they were worth 40,000 bucks! Now that they were all broken, she had to take responsibility. Immediately, the waitress was enraged. She looked at Yolanda who was trying to escape while pretending nothing had happened and grabbed her. She yelled, “Are you trying to run? Madam, you smashed six bottles of Lafites! Please</p>  <p id = > compensate us immediately.” “What? Stop talking nonsense. I’m warning you, I didn’t bump into you. You were the one who dropped and broke all of them. Stop falsely accusing me.” Yolanda shook her head furiously. She was frantic. She wanted so badly to run away. She knew she could not feel guilty right now. She had to look strong and powerful. Hence, she started to point at the waitress’ nose and yelled. That waitress did not want to show her weakness either. The two of them started arguing heatedly. Immediately, a group of people started gathering around them while gossiping and pointing at them. “Not you? Alright, let’s look at the security footage then!”</p>  <p id = > the waitress said loudly. This time, Yolanda panicked. She immediately apologized, “I-I didn’t do it on purpose. It was an accident.” Yolanda</p> <p id = > looked like a beauty with a tear-stained face. She looked so pitiful and wronged.</p>  <p id = > “You didn’t do it on purpose? Why didn’t you admit it just now? Now you’re saying it’s an accident. I think you did it on purpose!” The waitress was about to go insane from anger. She had never seen anyone like this.</p>  <p id = > This woman refused to own up for her mistakes. The waitress said, “Stop spewing rubbish. Pay for the damages now.” “Yeah, that woman is such a lying b*tch.” “Hehe, she looks so pretty but she’s a liar.” “This woman brings so much shame to all womankind.” The crowd started criticizing Yolanda. Their eyes were filled with disdain and contempt. Yolanda started sobbing from anxiousness. She felt even more frantic now, especially when so many people were criticizing her. She wailed, “I’ll pay! I’ll pay for everything, okay? Stop yelling at me!” Yolanda was scared, but at the same time, she was also feeling frantic. However, the criticisms did not stop. Even if she was at fault, it was not necessary for them to lecture her like this, right? Was it not enough that she owned up to her own mistakes and agreed to pay them back? Did she need to kneel and beg for forgiveness as well?</p>  <p id = > “Alright, Madam, please look closely. There are six bottles of Lafite here.</p>  <p id = > One bottle is 7,000 bucks, so the total is 42,000 bucks. Madam, are you paying with cash or card?” “What? 42,000 bucks? Impossible! You’re scamming me!” Yolanda was shocked. Tears rolled down her cheeks like</p>  <p id = > pearls on a broken string. 42,000 bucks? Where would she get so much money? “Do you think the Arc de Triumph Hotel will scam you? You don’t want your dignity, but we do. We still need to do business.” That waitress was fighting a battle of words. Even so, she was extremely calm. Yolanda’s legs were shaking from fear. She kept on looking at the floor. She did not have that kind of money. She could not even take out 2,000 bucks, let alone 42,000! “I… I don’t have the money. Can you give me a few days?”</p>  <p id = > Yolanda asked while crying. “No!” the waitress replied coldly. “I think you should just call the cops. I think she spent all her money on her face.”</p> <p id = > “Yeah, just call the cops.” The crowd said coldly. They were just here for the drama.</p>  <p id = > Plus, it was fun watching a pretty woman making a fool of herself. Yolanda started to break down. She wailed and said, “No! Don’t call the cops.”</p>  <p id = > Yolanda’s family was not rich. This 40,000 was the annual income of her family. “Pay up, then,” the waitress said. Yolanda was in a state of despair, and everyone was still criticizing her harshly. She felt like her world was crumbling in front of her eyes. “I… I don’t have the money.” At the same time, Philip ended his call and walked past them. He hesitated and walked into the crowd. Then, he understood what was going on. He said to the waitress, “I’ll pay for her.”</p>  <h2 id =chapter-217 > Chapter 217</h2>  <p id = > Everyone fell into a state of shock as they turned their heads to look at the young man who emerged from the crowd. He was just a normal guy. Who was he to say something like this? Was he trying to save the damsel in distress? That was 40,000 bucks! A lot of people started looking at him in detest. This guy was dressed so normally and yet, he was talking so big.</p>  <p id = > “Hehe, where did this penniless fool come from? He’s here trying to act like a big shot.” “Perhaps he has an ulterior motive toward her because she looks pretty.” “Him? He’s wearing cheap clothes. He’s obviously a loser.” Some people were making fun of him inside their hearts and out loud. They did not care about Philip’s feelings at all. Yolanda lifted her head and saw Philip</p>  <p id = > through her tears. She felt embarrassed. In her opinion, how would she not feel frustrated after being seen in such an embarrassing state by such a person? Plus, she thought Philip was here to make fun of her. “Philip, what are you doing here? Go away! I don’t need your help!” Yolanda yelled angrily. At this moment, Sadie ran over through the crowd. “Yola, what happened?” “Sadie…” When Yolanda saw Sadie, her tears escaped her eyes. She held onto Sadie and started sobbing. “It’s okay, Yola. What happened? Tell me.” Sadie comforted her and patted her back softly. She noticed the smashed bottles of wine on the floor as well as the puddle that had formed. She immediately understood what happened when she heard the criticisms from the crowd. Yolanda had gotten herself in trouble! “Sadie, I smashed six bottles of Lafite! She wants me to pay 42,000 bucks!”</p>  <p id = > Yolanda was crying sadly. “42,000?” Sadie was shocked. Her family was not too well-off either. She could not afford to fork out that amount immediately. She was regretting her decision to come out. Now that her best friend was asking her for help, it was difficult to reject. The waitress who was standing at one side was getting impatient. She snorted and said,</p>  <p id = > “Madam, please pay up now. We still have work to do. If not, I’ll call the cops.” There was such a huge crowd around them. If she did not handle this</p> <p id = > well, she would be criticized further. “Don’t call the cops. Please don’t. I’ll definitely pay.” Yolanda cried and shook her head. Then, she looked at Sadie hopefully and begged, “Sadie, you’re my best friend. You’ll help me, right?” Sadie was in a difficult position. She awkwardly said, “Yola, I… I don’t have that much money as well. You know about the situation in my family… I still have to pay for my brother’s studies.” When Yolanda heard this, she panicked. At the same time, she started to detest Sadie. People like her were fake friends indeed. Sadie became unreliable the moment Yolanda needed her the most. “Yola, why don’t you ask for help from Joshua? He must have the money. He might even help you pay for the damages. After all, you two just... So, he’ll not turn a blind eye to you when you’re in need, right?” Sadie suggested. “I… Will it work?” Yolanda was ashamed. Would</p>  <p id = > Joshua look down on her for asking him for help at a time like this? She had always maintained the image of a goddess in front of everyone. However, she did not have a choice now. “Hurry up, please. Are you going to pay or not? If not, I’ll call the cops.” The waitress urged. “I…” Yolanda could not stop her tears. Finally, she braced herself and took out her phone to call Joshua. Over here, Joshua was fuming. Suddenly, he got Yolanda’s call and she was sobbing. After he found out what had happened, he said in an overbearing manner, “Alright, wait for me. I’ll go over right now. It’s just a few bottles of wine. Is all this necessary?” Slam! After he hung up the phone, Joshua brought a few guys over to the scene intimidatingly. He shouted when he was still quite a distance away, “Hey, what happened?</p>  <p id = > You’re bullying my girlfriend, eh? It’s just a few bottles of stupid Lafite!</p>  <p id = > How much can they cost?” Joshua had been feeling frustrated earlier, which is why he could not wait to gain some respect back in front of all these people. When Yolanda saw Joshua, she ran into his arms and started wailing sadly. “Josh, they’re bullying me! They want me to pay 42,000 bucks!”</p>  <p id = > Yolanda sobbed. Her voice sounded coy and childish. Joshua held Yolanda and comforted her. “It’s okay, it’s just 42,000 bucks. I’ll pay for you.” When Yolanda heard that, a smile appeared on her face. She wiped her tears and thanked him profusely. “Thank you, Josh. Mua!” After she said that, she kissed Joshua on the face loudly. This gesture was extremely seductive to Joshua. He leaned into Yolanda’s ear and mumbled something. Then,</p> <p id = > Yolanda’s face turned bright red. Her legs started twisting together like two pieces of ropes. Then, Joshua said coldly to the waitress, “42,000 bucks, yeah? Put it on my bill. I’ll pay for it later.” The waitress saw that Joshua was acting like a boss, so she nodded and agreed. However, all of a sudden...</p>  <h2 id =chapter-218 > Chapter 218</h2>  <p id = > A man dressed in a suit walked over. He was the hall manager. He asked coldly, “Leah, what happened? Why are so many people here?” Before this, the hall manager named Bill Horton heard the commotion coming from over</p>  <p id = > here. When he saw the scene, he could guess what had happened. The waitress saw that the hall manager was here. She bowed and said, “Mr.</p>  <p id = > Horton, this madam smashed six bottles of a customer’s Lafite. I’m handling this.” When Bill heard this, he nodded and did not say anything. He even exchanged a few words with Joshua. However, when his eyes landed on the smashed bottles on the floor, he started to panic. “How much did you ask them to pay? 42,000 bucks?” Bill asked frantically. The waitress nodded her head. “Yes, Mr. Horton. Lafite. 7,000 bucks per bottle, so it’s 42,000 bucks for six.” Slap! Bill slapped the waitress across her cheek and roared, “Are you f*cking blind? 7,000 bucks per bottle? Look at the year of the wine!”</p>  <p id = > The slap was so sudden that the waitress was stunned. Tears welled up in her eyes as she started to stammer. Bill’s eyes were wide in anger. Then, he turned around with a smile on his face. He said to Joshua, “I’m sorry, Sir.</p>  <p id = > The waitress is new, so she doesn’t know anything. These are our latest batch of Lafite. They are a part of the collector’s edition from the year 1787.</p>  <p id = > There’re just six bottles in this entire city. Each of them costs 110,000</p>  <p id = > pounds.” Crack! The room fell silent. “What? 5.76 million yuan? Are you f*cking kidding me?” Joshua exploded. Were they not just bottles of f*cking wine? Yolanda was beyond shocked. She jumped out and yelled at Bill while pointing at him, “Damn it! I didn’t expect Arc de Triumph to be so shameless! You’re trying to overcharge the customers!” The crowd was so shocked that the colors from their faces were slowly being drained. What</p> <p id = > the heck? A bottle of wine that cost 960,000 bucks? Six bottles would be 5.76 million bucks! This was daylight robbery! Bill’s face fell. He tugged on his suit and picked up a smashed bottle from the floor calmly. He said,</p>  <p id = > “Everyone, look closely. The year is written here clearly. If you don’t believe me, you can check how much a bottle of Lafite from 1787 costs online. I’m only telling everyone that there are only six bottles in this entire city. These are genuine goods at fair prices. Arc de Triumph had been operating for so many years, and we’ve never lied to our customers. If you think that I’m lying, you can call the market regulators to come and</p>  <p id = > investigate us anytime.” Bill’s face was despicable. These people had no experience in life. If they did not even know a 1787 Lafite, who were they to talk about alcohol? Joshua was shocked. He took the glass shard and indeed, ‘1787’ was clearly printed on the label. However, he would not give in to this without a fight. These bottles of wine cost f*cking 5.76 million bucks! His company only had a current account of more than three million every month. How would he pay for this? Joshua started to panic. He said to Yolanda while stammering, “Um, Yolanda, you’re in big trouble! 5.76</p>  <p id = > million! I… I can’t afford that.” When Yolanda heard that, she grabbed onto Joshua and wailed, “Josh, they’re lying! Those things don’t cost 5.76 million bucks! They must be bluffing. We’ll just pay 40,000 bucks!” How could she not panic? If this was real, she would not be able to pay for them even if she sold her body. “Bluffing?” Bill’s face turned cold as he said, “Madam, please ask around. When did Arc de Triumph ever lie to our customers?</p>  <p id = > You’re not paying, right? Then I can only call the cops and let them handle this.” When Joshua heard that they were going to call the cops, he stood at one side timidly. He did not want to get involved in this anymore. Yolanda wailed and begged, but it was of no use. That was almost six million bucks!</p>  <p id = > Which sugar daddy would be dumb enough to pay for her? However, Philip, who had been standing there quietly the entire time opened his mouth suddenly. He said, “Um, why don’t you just let this go for my sake?”</p>    <h2 id =chapter-219 > Chapter 219</h2>  <p id = > When everyone heard this, they were shocked. What did ‘for my sake’</p>  <p id = > meant? Did his name cost six million? Joshua frowned when he heard what Philip said. He was unhappy as he retorted, “Philip, are you an idiot? Didn’t you hear what he said? Six bottles of them cost six million bucks! Who are you? Are you even worth six million bucks?” Philip must be trying to be a poser again! He would just watch how he was going to make a fool out of himself. Yolanda’s face was filled with anger and frustration. Philip kept jumping out to be a poser. In the end, not only would he embarrass himself, but he would also embarrass Yolanda. “Philip, get lost! This has nothing to do with you!” Yolanda shrieked tearfully. She was fuming. That piece of trash was still trying to be a poser at a time like this. Philip shook his head and smiled helplessly. He looked at the waitress and said, “I’ll pay the six million bucks.” Even if Yolanda and Joshua refused to believe him, Philip still wanted to help. After all, they were ex-classmates. Was he purposely causing trouble for himself? Maybe. The waitress lifted her eyebrow and looked at Philip from head to toe. She said in disdain, “You’re paying? Sir, listen carefully, six bottles of 1787 Lafite cost 5.76 million! Can you afford it?” The waitress did not want to look down on Philip, but his outfit was too ordinary! Plus, she had overheard his friends belittling him like that. How could he still have the courage to stand up for them? Was he dropped on the head when he was born? The people around him were all jeering at him.</p>  <p id = > They were pointing at Philip while hurling abuses at him. “Hehe, that guy is such a dumb*ss!” “I’ve never seen such a shameless guy before. He just had to come out and be a poser. We’ll just wait for this to backfire.” “Sigh, men are indeed animals who think with their lower halves. He doesn’t even want his dignity after seeing a pretty lady.” Philip was unbothered by everyone’s detest and laughter. He said, “What if I’m able to afford it?” The waitress chuckled. When she was about to yell at him, Bill turned around and looked at Philip. Suddenly, his pupils constricted! “Sir, please don’t interfere with this, okay? Do you think a man like you is able to pay for this?” The waitress sneered. Suddenly... Slap! A loud slap landed on the</p> <p id = > waitress’ face while everyone watched. “Mr… Mr. Horton, why did you slap me?” The waitress was puzzled. She clutched her red face. Her eyes were filled with tears and grievances. This scene shocked everyone. Holy moly! What the hell was happening? In the next second, everyone fell into a state of shock once again. They saw Bill walking toward Philip before bowing. He said respectfully, “I’m sorry, Mr. Clarke. She’s new here, so she doesn’t know you. I hope you can be so generous to forgive her and not take this to heart.” Mr. Clarke? Everyone inhaled sharply and looked at each other. They were beyond confused. This wretched-looking idiot was someone respectable? Was this a joke? Joshua lifted his eyebrows. He was feeling agitated as he said, “Mr. Horton, are you an idiot? Philip only has some performance shares in his delivery company. How f*cking respectable can he be?” He was unhappy. He did not expect Mr. Horton to treat Philip so humbly. However, Bill turned his head and glared at Joshua. He roared,</p>  <p id = > “Shut up! What do you know? Mr. Clarke is our…” He stopped abruptly.</p>  <p id = > Philip interrupted Bill and said calmly, “That’s enough, Mr. Horton. Just let this matter go.” Bill nodded quickly and said, “Alright, I’ll listen to everything you say, Mr. Clarke.” Slap! An invisible slap landed on everyone’s faces. This slap had come too fast! Philip Clarke? They were going to wave the six million bucks for Philip’s sake? Everyone’s eyes were wide. They looked like they were in disbelief. Yolanda stopped sobbing.</p>  <p id = > She stared at Philip and Bill. She asked, “Re-really?” Bill looked frustrated.</p>  <p id = > This stupid woman still did not want to believe him. He announced solemnly once more, “Yes, you don’t have to pay anymore.” “Thank you! Thank you!” When Yolanda heard that, she bowed and kept thanking Bill while nodding. However, Bill said, “Madam, you should be thanking Mr. Clarke instead.” Philip? Yolanda frowned and looked at Philip who was playing on his phone calmly. She was extremely puzzled. After pondering for a while, she still thanked Philip. “Philip, thank you. If you’re free, we… We can…”</p>  <p id = > What could she do? Yolanda only knew how to pay someone back with her body. Did Philip have no ulterior motives in saving her? This pervert must</p> <p id = > be hoping to sleep with her. Yolanda’s heart was confused. On one side, there was Joshua. On the other side, there was Philip. She knew everything about Joshua, but Yolanda was confused about Philip. Who was he? Did he really just have some performance shares in his company?</p>  <h2 id =chapter-220 > Chapter 220</h2>  <p id = > However, Philip replied calmly, “It’s fine. We’re all old classmates. It’s nothing.” After he said that, he took his phone and went over to one side to take a call without waiting for everyone. When the crowd dispersed, Joshua swung his arms and left with his men angrily. Yolanda and Sadie stayed where they were. They were waiting for Philip. “Yola, I don’t think Philip is what he seems to be. That’s six million bucks! He can just not pay if he wants to. This must be an act, right?” Sadie was curious. Yolanda was also confused. Was the Philip she knew the same man as the one who was talking in a domineering manner just now? Coincidentally, Philip walked back.</p>  <p id = > Yolanda ran up to him impatiently. She was blushing when she asked, “Philip, do I really not have to pay back that six million dollars to you?”</p>  <p id = > Philip nodded and said, “Don’t worry. I know the boss of this place, so it’s fine.” Yolanda was shocked. Her eyes went wide as she said in astonishment, “You know the boss of Arc de Triumph?” Philip nodded and replied, “Yeah. He’s an old friend.” ‘Will you wet your pants if I tell you that I’m the boss?’ After hearing this, Yolanda’s restless heart finally calmed down. It turned out that Philip only knew the boss of this place. She thought he was someone special. Hmph! Philip was feeling helpless.</p>  <p id = > Yolanda’s attitude had changed too fast! After a few steps, Yolanda turned around and took out her phone. She said, “Um, Philip, give me your friend’s number. I have to thank him in person.” Yolanda remembered out of the blue that she had to meet the boss of Arc de Triumph. If possible, she wanted to wrap him around her fingers as well. Philip was taken aback. He asked,</p>  <p id = > “Why don’t you thank me?” Yolanda was stunned. She said rudely, “Didn’t I just thank you?” Philip was feeling helpless. After thinking about it, he</p>  <p id = > gave her his other number. After Yolanda got the number, she was ecstatic.</p> <p id = > She said, “Alright. When it’s done, I’ll treat you to a meal.” ‘When it’s done? ‘When what is done?’ Philip was confused as he watched Yolanda walk away. What was this woman planning? Philip was about to leave.</p>  <p id = > When he was at the door, Zayn ran over to send him off. He even chatted</p>  <p id = > with Philip respectfully. Philip’s other phone rang. He took it out and saw</p> <p id = > that he had just received a message. It was from Yolanda. ‘Hey you, thank</p> <p id = > you for what happened tonight. Are you free? I want to treat you to a meal.</p>  <p id = > (Shy)’ Philip was speechless. This was what Yolanda was planning! He smiled helplessly and did not reply. However, he was then spammed with messages from Yolanda. She was flirting with him and trying to get his attention. Philip was feeling helpless. He replied, ‘Who are you?’ Yolanda replied instantly, ‘Filthy rich boss, you’re finally replying to my messages!</p>  <p id = > I was the one who accidentally smashed the bottles of red wine in your restaurant. Philip told me you’re his friend, so that's why I don’t have pay.</p>  <p id = > However, I don’t feel good about this, so I want to treat you to a meal as an apology.’ Philip chuckled and replied, ‘It’s fine. You can spare the meal.’</p>  <p id = > After that, Philip ignored her. Yolanda and Sadie were loitering in the parking lot. When she realized that the other party was ignoring her, she finally gave up. “Let’s go. This looks like a long-term plan for major returns,” Yolanda said. However, at the same time, she saw a familiar figure getting into a pink Porsche 911 from the corner of her eyes. Yolanda’s face was filled with shock and confusion. She asked Sadie who was by her side,</p>  <p id = > “Sadie, do you think that guy just now looks like Philip?” Sadie squinted and said, “I think so. Do you want to go over and take a look?” Yolanda frowned and got up. She said, “Let go and take a look.”</p>  <h2 id =chapter-221 > Chapter 221</h2>  <p id = > Yolanda and Sadie quickly walked over to the pink Porsche. The closer she got, the more shocked Yolanda became. That person looked too much like Philip even if it was just his side profile. He was also chatting and smoking</p>  <p id = > with a tall, muscular man. “Philip?” Yolanda called out. The other party looked over. When he saw that it was Yolanda, he was taken aback. He asked, “Didn’t you leave already?” Philip felt helpless. He did not expect to run into Yolanda when he was smoking with Tiger. Yolanda’s eyes wandered around. She stared at Philip before gluing her eyes on Tiger. This car must definitely belong to this man. Could Philip be the owner of this Porsche? Impossible! Even a battery-operated bike would be too good for a man like this. Yolanda grabbed Sadie’s arm in the first instant and started to flirt with Tiger. “Hey hot stuff, is this car yours?” Tiger looked at Yolanda and Sadie in confusion. These two women looked gorgeous, and their bodies were amazing as well. He wanted to say no, but before Tiger could say anything, Philip said, “Yes.” When Yolanda heard that, she beamed.</p>  <p id = > However, she stared at Philip and said in agitation, “Who are you to be so nosey? What are you looking at? Hurry up and get lost.” Yolanda was being unreasonable and was acting from mercenary considerations. Philip knew this very well. He touched his nose helplessly and said, “I’m smoking. I’ll go away in a bit.” Yolanda rolled her eyes at him before proceeding to ask Tiger a lot of questions. She looked extremely passionate. Tiger was puzzled. If Philip said it was his car, then it was his car. “Hey, Tiger, do you know Philip?” Yolanda and Sadie were grabbing Tiger’s arms from both sides. They peered at Philip curiously. Tiger smiled timidly and said,</p>  <p id = > “Yeah.” Yolanda and Sadie looked at each other. They were both shocked.</p>  <p id = > It seemed that Philip was doing great. The boss of Arc de Triumph was his friend and he also knew this affluent Tiger. Yolanda started to think more of Philip. This guy was doing a good job of hiding his true identity. “Hey, let’s go,” Philip took a drag of his cigarette and said to Tiger. Then, he opened the door of the backseat to climb in. Yolanda started to panic. She ran</p> <p id = > forward and pulled Philip out. She scolded coldly, “Philip! What are you doing? How can you get into his car?” Sadie crossed her arms across her chest and sneered at Philip. She said, “Hehe, I think something’s wrong with his brain. Look closely, Philip. This is a Porsche, not a cab. What a country</p>  <p id = > bumpkin.” Philip was stunned. What did he do? He asked, “Why can’t I?”</p>  <p id = > Yolanda snorted and said fiercely, “You’re still asking why? Why don’t you take a look at yourself? Do you think you’re all that because you have some performance shares in a stupid delivery company? That’s Tiger’s car. Are you even qualified to sit inside? Plus, did you ask for Tiger’s permission?”</p>  <p id = > The owner of the car was here, but he got in without even asking for permission first. Did he have any manners? Plus, Yolanda had already decided to make the passenger seat of this Porsche hers tonight. She also wanted to post pictures of the car to her WeChat moment to show off! Philip touched his nose and looked at Tiger. Tiger did not say anything before slapping Yolanda across the face angrily. Slap! The sound reverberated in the parking lot. “Tiger! Why did you slap me?” Yolanda was taken aback.</p>  <p id = > The slap was so hard that Yolanda even spun a few times on the spot. Her ears started buzzing as well. “Shut up! You’re asking for death!” Tiger roared ferociously. Yolanda was shocked and terrified. She grabbed onto Sadie and wailed, “Tiger, why did you hit me? I was just speaking up for you!” Yolanda was unhappy. She was slapped for no reason, and her face was now swollen. She was extremely unlucky today. She should have never gotten out of the house. Tiger glared at Yolanda. This b*tch deserved to die!</p>  <p id = > Then, he turned around and said to Philip respectfully, “Mr. Clarke, please get in.” When Yolanda and Sadie saw this, they were stunned. What… What did this mean? Did this car not belong to Tiger? “Tiger, what did you call him just now? Isn’t this car yours?” Yolanda blinked a few times. Her face was filled with disbelief. Was there anything more shocking than this? This gigantic man was being so respectful toward Philip. Before Tiger could say anything, Philip said calmly, “Yeah, it’s not mine, but he’s my driver.”</p> <p id = > Driver? Sadie suddenly remembered Philip saying that the driver had taken a shortcut when he came here just now. Was Tiger with his pink Porsche Philip’s driver? This was insane!</p>  <h2 id =chapter-222 > Chapter 222</h2>  <p id = > Tiger politely gestured to Philip to get into the car before glaring at Yolanda and Sadie. He said, “Go back and ask others about me, Tiger from Lord North Street. In the future, if you dare disrespect Mr. Clarke, don’t blame me for not going easy on you!” Yolanda and Sadie watched as Philip left in the stylish Porsche. Yolanda was unconvinced. She snapped a picture of the car’s number plate and asked angrily, “Sadie, do you believe that he’s Philip’s driver?” Sadie was puzzled. She said, “I’m not sure. However, I’ve heard my ex-boyfriend talk about Tiger.” Yolanda blamed Philip for the slap. Furious, she sent the car plate to Joshua and said, “Josh, I saw Philip leave in this car. Check who the car belongs to for me.” Joshua had felt agitated throughout the entire night. When he received Yolanda’s message, he became even angrier. What? That useless bum Philip left in a Porsche 911? Impossible! Joshua replied immediately, “Alright, give me five minutes.” Five minutes later, Joshua found out that the car belonged to a young woman who was 20-years-old. Consequently, Joshua called Yolanda and said sarcastically, “I’m going to die from laughter. That car belongs to a little girl. My guess is that she’s a nouveau riche. Say, is Philip her sugar baby?” When Yolanda heard that, her heart became filled with disdain and scorn for Philip. Philip was a sugar baby? How disgusting! Did that mean he was being unfaithful to his wife? Yolanda had to find a chance to tell Wynn and separate them. Additionally, she wanted Philip to leave his marriage without a single penny! “F*ck! He got himself some rich lady.</p>  <p id = > How disgusting!” Yolanda berated as she turned around to leave with Sadie.</p>  <p id = > Over on the other side, Tiger brought Philip to the hospital. When Philip entered Mila’s room, he saw her playing with the dolls of Snow White and the Seven Dwarves. Her hair was tied in pigtails, and she looked adorable.</p>  <p id = > Mila’s eyes were huge, and her skin was like porcelain. Moreover, her cheeks had some baby fat on them. She said childishly, “Daddy, come play with me!” Philip approached her and sat on the floor. He pretended to be the witch from the story as he made a scary face. Philip said in an evil tone,</p> <p id = > “Daddy has an apple. Do you want to give it to Snow White?” Mila rolled</p>  <p id = > her eyes at Philip and said like an adult, “Daddy, you’re so childish. I don’t want to play with you anymore.” Having said that, Mila turned her head around and began to ignore Philip. Philip felt defeated and spent a lot of time coaxing her afterward. Eventually, he asked, “Mila, who gave you these?” Mila pouted but then beamed shortly after. “They’re from a beautiful big sister. She asked me to call her Miss Chloe.” Chloe Sommerset! Philip’s face fell. After playing with Mila for a little longer, he left the hospital and called Chloe. Philip said rudely, “Chloe, thank you for the dolls but please stop sending them. Wynn doesn’t like them.” Blunt and straight to the point. “Philip, is it really your wife, or is it you who doesn’t like them?” Chloe faked a smile on the other end of the phone. Philip continued to say in a flat tone, “We don’t like them. What are you trying to do? I advise you to go back to Capital City. I can give you an explanation of what happened between us.” “Explanation?” Chloe chuckled coldly. She said, “Philip, what kind of explanation can you give me? You’re hiding it from your wife. Are you even a man?” Chloe was amused. She could not understand; How had Philip who had been so fearless and arrogant back then become such a spineless coward? “It’s none of your business. In short, I’m warning you. Don’t test my limit. Also, don’t try to do anything to Wynn or Mila!” Philip warned. He was well aware of Chloe’s personality.</p>  <p id = > She would not stop unless she achieved her goal. “I’m afraid you’re going to be disappointed. Guess where I am right now.” Chloe chuckled airily.</p>  <p id = > Philip could hear a few vague sounds. “Miss Sommerset, why are you at our office?” It was Wynn’s voice! “Chloe Sommerset! What are you going to do?” Philip’s face fell. He ran out of the hospital, ready to run all the way to Wynn’s office. “Philip, you have ten minutes. You’ll know what I’m about to do in ten minutes,” Chloe coldly said into the phone. Then, slam! She hung up. Back in the VP’s office in Beacon Pharmaceutical. Chloe could be seen sitting on the sofa like an arrogant queen. On the other hand, Wynn stood in front of her with a swollen face; there was blood on the corner of her lips. There were two bodyguards in black behind Wynn, holding her</p> <p id = > arms tightly. One could immediately tell who was the culprit that had caused the wounds on Wynn’s face.</p>  <h2 id =chapter-223 > Chapter 223</h2>  <p id = > Wynn glared angrily at Chloe who was sitting in front of her. Wynn had not expected Chloe to be so unreasonable. The latter had barged into her office with her bodyguards and asked them to restrain her arms. Another two bodyguards stood outside the office as they blocked the entrance. A lot of employees had gathered outside the door and were now anxiously watching what was happening. Evidently, they had witnessed VP Johnston get slapped six times in the office by the woman. Even the chairman, Derrick, had been stopped at the door, unable to enter the room. It was not that he did not want to go in, but he truly could not afford to offend the woman inside the VP’s office. 600 million bucks! She had used 600 million bucks to buy the company in one go! Derrick was now only the temporary chairman of the company, while Chloe was the real boss. Chloe looked at the Patek Philippe watch on Wynn’s wrist that had a crystal embedded in it and said nonchalantly, “Philip should be here in ten minutes.” “Philip?”</p>  <p id = > Wynn’s eyes grew wide. She said in a low voice, “Miss Sommerset, why did you ask him to come? If you’re looking to cause trouble, I’m the only one you should look for. You don’t need to involve him.” Wynn had begun to panic. If Philip saw her in such a state, she was scared that Philip would do something out of bounds. What had happened to Yasmin was an example. Additionally, in Wynn’s eyes, Philip could not compare to Chloe in terms of wealth. If Philip really ended up doing something to Chloe, she could not imagine what would happen to him. Nevertheless, Chloe smirked and said, “Philip was the one who wronged me first. So it’s only right for me to punish you, b*tch. Philip deserves to be here to watch this. He has to witness this. If he can’t give me an explanation, I wouldn’t think twice of making you disappear from the face of the earth!” Disappear from the face of this earth? Wynn was taken aback, and her entire body went limp from</p>  <p id = > fear. Chloe’s tone was so full of hatred that it was scary! What was she planning to do? Chloe could tell that Wynne was very nervous. She added coldly, “Wynn, if you don’t want anything to happen to your daughter, I advise you to divorce Philip as soon as possible. I wouldn’t want to see anything happen to your daughter.” It was a threat! A blatant one at that! At</p> <p id = > the moment, Chloe had an icy air around her. She looked extremely menacing. That was especially true for her eyes that looked sinister and evil!</p>  <p id = > Nonetheless, Wynn would not submit to her just like that. Not when Mila was being involved! “Chloe Sommerset, I’m warning you. Don’t you dare touch my daughter, if not, I’ll kill you!” Wynn stopped feeling afraid and became rather fearless all of a sudden as she started to struggle with all her might. However, she soon began to feel pain as the two bodyguards in black that were holding her arms tightened their grips. “What did you say? Are you threatening me?” Chloe laughed. The expression on her face was stone cold. Furthermore, the aura she was exuding was rather terrifying; it was more than capable to make someone feel anxious. It could be said that the grandeur she had from being born in a huge family was oozing out. At this point, Wynn looked like an egg, while Chloe was a rock. The former was threatening someone who was much stronger than her. Therefore, to no surprise, when Wynn looked into Chloe’s eyes, her imposing manner was crushed. The VP’s office had an extremely suffocating air to it. Even the employees who were watching had begun to tremble. “Chloe, what are you trying to do?” Wynn asked after suppressing the fear in her heart.; she somehow managed to set aside the extreme stress she was feeling. Chloe looked at Wynn silently and stood up. She then approached Wynn from the front and slapped her. While looking at Wynn disdainfully and full of scorn, she said, “You’re not qualified to ask me that.” When Wynn heard that, she could feel her entire body explode from anger. Chloe was so boastful and egoistic. Wynn gritted her teeth and said, “Chloe, I’m advising you to leave now. Philip won’t forgive you when he gets here.” At this moment, the only thing Wynn could think of was Philip. Chloe scoffed and said, “Wynn, you</p>  <p id = > place too much importance on yourself. You might not know it, but you’re only a dispensable item to Philip. You don't even know what Philip works as. So, who are you to talk to me in that tone?” “I don’t care what Philip works as. The only thing I know is that he’s my husband!” Wynn replied fearlessly. Slap! More pain was inflicted as Chloe struck Wynn again with all her might. The former’s eyes were able to make one feel fearful. Wynn’s face was bright red at this point and blood had started flowing out from the corner of her lips. “Kill me right now if you have the guts to do so!” Wynn</p> <p id = > was strong. She refused to back down even at a time like this. If Wynn had been scared of Chloe earlier, then, it could be said that she had completely won in terms of vigor. Chloe became enraged! Wynn was a b*tch that had an exaggerated opinion of her own abilities. Did she really think Chloe would not do anything to her? “I don’t think you’ll ever remember who Chloe Sommerset is unless I teach you a lesson!” Chloe said before hinting to her bodyguards with her eyes. The two bodyguards grabbed Wynn and firmly pressed her head down against the ground. They then started kicking Wynn’s calves. Wynn groaned and buckled in pain before collapsing to the ground in a kneeling position. The two bodyguards pressed down against Wynn’s head once more and yelled, “Apologize to Miss Sommerset now!”</p>  <p id = > Chloe looked at Wynn from where she stood and chuckled coldly. She said,</p>  <p id = > “Wynn, weren’t you ready to die to preserve your chastity? What are you doing now? Are you begging me? Say it then. If you beg me, I’ll let you go.” Wynn was unwilling to play along. Hence, she struggled angrily, but the bodyguards were too strong. She could not escape no matter what.</p>  <p id = > Wynn lifted her gaze and glared at Chloe. She spat out some blood and chuckled.</p>  <p id = > “I won’t beg for your mercy even if I die! Chloe, is this the only thing you’re capable of?” When Chloe heard Wynn’s words, she was so livid that her face became twisted. Consequently, she lifted her hand to slap Wynn again.</p>  <h2 id =chapter-224 > Chapter 224</h2>  <p id = > Suddenly! A roar came from the door! “Stop it!” Philip had arrived at the scene and could see what was happening. His eyes were bulging and it was as if they were going to pop out of their sockets! ‘Damn you, Chloe. You’re asking to die!’ ‘You’re asking to die!’ Chloe turned around and saw Philip’s bloodshot eyes. However, she did not stop. Instead, she swung her hand and slapped Wynn across the face. Additionally, Chloe had a smirk on her face.</p>  <p id = > In an instant, Philip was engulfed in rage. Outside the door, the two bodyguards could be seen holding out their hands to block Philip.</p>  <p id = > Nevertheless, Philip kicked both of them and sent them flying. Philip no longer had anything to hide. He did not hold back and instead used the skills he had learned from Reed in the past. “Chloe Sommerset! You’re digging your own grave!” Philip roared as he stood by the door, his hands balled up in fists. Philip had lost all rationality from rage, and his pupils were constricted. Not to mention, when he saw the wounds on Wynn’s face and her kneeling posture that was on the floor in front of so many people. Bam!</p>  <p id = > One kick and a punch. The two bodyguards who had been restraining Wynn were instantly defeated by Philip. They collapsed to the ground, and their bodies began to twitch. It was unknown if they were alive or dead. Philip’s eyes were red as he helped Wynn up and inhaled deeply. Afterward, he turned around and glared at Chloe. How dare she hit Wynn? How dare she ask Wynn to kneel? Chloe had crossed the line with Philip! “Philip, I wasn’t expecting to see an image of the past of yourself. Shouldn’t you be thanking me? I’m the one who made you remember your true nature.” Chloe was not worried that Philip would hit her and thus continued to talk arrogantly.</p>  <p id = > Philip smirked. His face was stone cold, and his voice sounded like the devil as he said, “Chloe Sommerset, you asked for this!” Slap! Philip lifted his hand and struck Chloe. Chloe fell onto the sofa immediately. Her eyes were filled with disbelief as she held her face. Chloe yelled hysterically,</p> <p id = > “Philip, how dare you slap me!” “Why would I not dare?” Philip replied angrily.</p>  <p id = > “Chloe, I warned you several times not to provoke me, most importantly, not to harm Wynn. Why didn’t you listen to me?” At this moment, every</p>  <p id = > employee in the company was shocked by Philip’s performance. Was this Wynn’s good-for-nothing husband? Was he that savage? Wynn was standing behind Philip, and it was the first time she felt that Philip had turned into a brand new person. He seemed like a stranger to her. Especially the vibe Philip was exuding at the moment. It was so scary that it was 100</p>  <p id = > times, or even 10 thousand times, scarier than Chloe’s just now. Chloe got up from the sofa and said furiously, “Philip, you’ll regret having hit me today!” Philip scoffed and said, “Chloe, don’t try to challenge me. The Sommersets are nothing to me! Don’t forget who’s the one who helped the Sommersets regain their position.” Crack! A clap of thunder struck Chloe’s heart. Philip was right. The reason why the Sommersets had been able to reclaim their place as the number one big shot in Capital City was all thanks to Philip. Chloe had become too used to being a socialite that she had forgotten how her family had signed a contract of alliance with Philip in the past. As Chloe thought of it, her body went limp, and she fell backward onto the sofa. On the other hand, just as Philip was about to say something, Wynn stopped him. She shook her head and said, “That’s enough, Philip. I’m fine.”</p>  <p id = > Wynn did not understand what Philip was talking to Chloe about. However, she did not want Philip to offend Chloe because of her. That was because Wynn knew that the Sommersets were rich and powerful. Could Philip afford to offend them? Philip looked at Wynn, and his cold eyes turned gentle as he said, “Alright.” After saying that, he ignored Chloe and left with Wynn. Behind him, Chloe yelled hysterically, “Philip, you’ll regret this! I’m sure!” After they left Beacon, Philip brought Wynn to the hospital to check her wounds. After taking the prescribed medicine, Wynn hesitated for a long time in the waiting area before asking out of the blue, “Philip, are you hiding something from me?”</p>  <h2 id =chapter-225 > Chapter 225</h2>  <p id = > Philip knew what he had done at Beacon Pharmaceutical was overbearing and somewhat cruel. It was only understandable that Wynn had become</p>  <p id = > suspicious of him. Should he tell her his true identity? No. Giada was already in Riverdale, and Philip did not know what that woman was planning. She would not come to Riverdale without a reason. Hence, she had to be planning something. He was restricting himself a lot by agreeing to that woman’s conditions. If Philip did not need to protect the people he loved by adhering to her conditions, he would have turned the world upside down already. “Wynnie, do you really want to know?” Philip asked with a raised brow. Wynn hesitated before nodding shortly after. “I want to know about your past. I have a feeling that you’re not the Philip that I know. Did you used to be the way you were just now?” Philip shook his head and lied as he said, “No no no, not at all.” If Wynn found out about those ridiculous and despotic things he had done in the past, there was a chance she would go insane. After staying silent for a while and composing his thoughts, Philip said, “Chloe and I are from aristocratic families. A long time ago, there was a marriage contract between the two of us. However, I only saw her as my little sister. So, on the day of the engagement, I fought with my father and ran away from home. I wasn’t expecting Chloe to resent me for seven whole years. Do women like holding grudges?” Philip was not telling the entire truth. However, after Wynn heard Philip’s explanation, she believed him. She said, “It was an engagement party, and you ran away without saying anything. You didn’t even give her a reason or an explanation. If I were in her position, I would resent you for seven years too.</p>  <p id = > I might even want to kill you.” All of a sudden, Wynn felt sorry for Chloe.</p>  <p id = > She was a pitiful woman as well. Wynn could not imagine her husband to have been such a horrible person back then. “Oh right, Philip, when are you going to take me to see your parents? Since your parents arranged the marriage for you, aren’t they extra fond of Chloe? Would they refuse to recognize us if they found out about me and Mila?” Wynn started to feel</p> <p id = > anxious; the tone of her voice was gradually becoming lower and lower. She was worried that Philip’s parents would not recognize her. Even if they refused to recognize her, they had to recognize Mila. She was their</p>  <p id = > granddaughter. Philip squinted his eyes and looked at the changes in expression on Wynn’s face. He laughed and said, “What are you thinking about? Don’t worry. You’re my wife, and Mila is my daughter. They won’t refuse to recognize you. If they really end up being unwilling to recognize you, whatever. As long as the three of us are together, we’ll be happy.”</p>  <p id = > Happiness was that simple to Philip. It was the same happiness he had left his home seven years ago in search of. Wynn rolled her eyes at him and said,</p>  <p id = > “You’re making this seem way too easy. I just hope that Mila gets to live a better life. Even if my in-laws refuse to recognize me, it’ll be fine as long as they recognize Mila.” That was a mother’s love. Philip patted Wynn’s shoulder and held her in his arms. He said, “It’s fine. I’m here.” Just like that, Wynn leaned against Philip’s shoulder and begun daydreaming about meeting Philip’s parents with her family. No, she had to prepare for it. Even if it was only her work, she had to thrive for success. She had to make Philip’s parents at least recognize one of her qualities. The Clarkes owned Northern Sky Western Restaurant so they had to be loaded. Philip’s parents had to have a lot of emphasis on their daughter-in-law’s upbringing, self-cultivation, and personal status. No wonder Chloe had been his fiance. She was excellent indeed, and her family background was superior.</p>  <p id = > Additionally, she was pretty and strong. She was the perfect candidate as Philip’s wife who was capable of helping him manage his family and restaurant. As Wynn thought about it, she started to feel inferior.</p>  <p id = > Consequently, she became moody. Philip was unaware of this as he asked happily, “Right, Wynnie, are you free tonight? I’ll wait for you in your office.” Wynn was shocked. She looked at Philip who was acting mysteriously and asked dumbfoundedly, “Yeah, what’s wrong? What are you planning to do?” Philip smiled slyly and said, “Hehe, it’s a secret.</p> <p id = > You’ll know when the time comes.” The two of them bickered for a while and then went to the hospital to be with Mila. Mila would undergo surgery in three days. Professor Turner was ready to carry out the surgery and had begun checking on Mila daily for the past few days. At the same time, he</p>  <p id = > had made sure to finalize the surgery’s procedure and the recovery process that was to follow. In the evening, Martha’s continuous calls out of the blue summoned Philip to her house. When Philip entered the house, he could feel the chilly air. Martha was seated on the sofa, and it was obvious that she was mad. Additionally, she carried a fit of anger that would burn one’s insides. “Mom, what’s wrong? Who made you angry?” Philip asked carefully. Martha took out the mop she had prepared earlier and struck Philip with it. As she hit him, she yelled, “You useless thing! You spendthrift! Look at what you’ve done! There are so many things in the world, and you just had to give Emperor Qianlong’s ornamental thumb ring that’s made of jade away! Did you not know how much that thing is worth?”</p>  <p id = > Philip could not fight back and could only endure being hit. After hitting Philip several more times, Matha became tired. She put one hand on her hip and pointed at Philip with the other before shrieking at him with saliva flying all over the place, “You’re going to kill me by engulfing me in anger!</p>  <p id = > What did we do to get a useless son-in-law like you? You spendthrift!”</p>  <p id = > Martha was angry. That thing was worth 100 million bucks, and Philip had given it away in a state of confusion! Naturally, Martha had not asked for it to be returned. Instead, she was scolded by her father in the Yates Manor was asked to scram back to Riverdale. On the way back, she was humiliated and laughed at by her sister, Paula.</p>  <h2 id =chapter-226 > Chapter 226</h2>  <p id = > When Martha got home, she was still in a fit of rage. Hence, she called Philip to come over. She had to vent her anger. Philip finally understood why she was so mad. It must have been because the Yates were aware of the thumb ring’s value. What should he do now? Were they suspicious of his identity?</p>  <p id = > “Mom, what’s going on? What do you mean 100 million?” Philip asked, pretending to be innocent. Martha became even angrier when she saw Philip’s face. She yelled, “You worthless bum! You don’t know anything!</p>  <p id = > Get out! Get out now! I get so angry when I look at you!” “Okay.” His</p>  <p id = > mother-in-law was still mad, so he did not want to stay there anymore either.</p>  <p id = > Hence, Philip turned around to leave. However, before Philip could leave, Martha shrieked bossily out of the blue, “Wait, come back!” “Is there something else, mom?” Philip asked. Martha pondered and asked, “You…</p>  <p id = > Did you really get that thumb ring from an antique market?” Martha still felt suspicious. “Yeah. I bought it at the same time when I bought that painting for dad. What’s wrong? Is it valuable?” Philip pretended to be excited. “Of course! You bastard! It’s not just valuable. When Mr. Field evaluated its worth, we found out that it costs 100 million bucks! 100 million! You spendthrift!” Martha was beginning to feel sad again; she collapsed on the sofa and started bawling while rolling around. After making a fuss, Martha got up and grabbed Philip’s hand. She said, “Come, take me to the same market. Let us buy a few more.” Philip was surprised, but he understood what Martha was trying to do. Did she think he was an expert? “Mom, it was just blind luck. I bought that thing randomly,” Philip said helplessly.</p>  <p id = > His mother-in-law was so unpredictable. Did she love money that much?</p> <p id = > Martha turned a deaf ear to all his words. Her mind was occupied with obtaining 100 million bucks. She said in dissatisfaction, “Are you going to come with me or not? If you’re not coming, then get out of my house! I’ll ask Wynn to divorce you!” What was Philip trying to say now? Was he turning a deaf ear to everything she had said? He was being truant! Philip looked at Martha’s furious face and came to the conclusion that he did not have much of a choice. He nodded and said, “Alright, I’ll come, but I don’t have any money with me right now.” When Martha heard him say he did not have any money, she took a step back. She looked at Philip cautiously and asked, “How much?” Philip thought for a while and said randomly,</p>  <p id = > “Two to three thousand I guess.” “That much? Are you scamming me?”</p>  <p id = > Martha yelled. Clearly, the act of asking her for two to three thousand bucks was equivalent to asking her to slice her own flesh. Philip replied and said that they indeed needed that much. Martha gritted her teeth and ran back to her bedroom after making up her mind. She took a few thousand bucks with</p>  <p id = > her and then urged Philip to hurry up. She was very set on trying her luck.</p>  <p id = > When they exited the house, Philip made an excuse that he had to buy something first and then called Russell’s number. On the other end of the phone, Russell asked respectfully, “Hello, Mr. Clarke, is there something I can help you with?” Philip did not beat around the bush. He said, “Are you familiar with the antique market?” “Yeah, I have a few friends over there.</p>  <p id = > What’s wrong? Do you want to buy some old things, Mr. Clarke? What do you need? Just tell me. I’ll send them to you as gifts,” Russell said flatteringly. “It’s n-nothing…” Philip then told Russell everything, and the latter admitted to being half responsible for the ordeal as he should not have revealed the true price of the thumb ring. Philip did not blame him and instead said, “We’ll meet at the antique market. You can randomly choose one for us. Just make my mother-in-law happy. I’ll return the money to you later.” How could Russell accept Philip’s money? He said quickly, “Mr.</p>  <p id = > Clarke, you’re too kind. Just treat this as a little gift from me to aunty. We’ll meet at the north entrance of the antique market.” “Alright.” Philip agreed and hung up the phone. Shortly after, he heard Martha’s impatient tone of</p> <p id = > voice as she called out to him, “Philip, what are you doing? Hurry up! What a good-for-nothing. I’m asking you to do something, and you’re dilly-dallying.” Philip felt helpless. He yelled out a reply and then brought Martha to the market. In the end, after they got to the market and met Russell, Martha proceeded to ignore Philip after exchanging greetings with Russell.</p>  <p id = > “Alright, Philip. You can go back now. Mr. Field will be here with me.”</p>  <p id = > Martha’s eyes were glued on Russell. She was extremely excited. He was the master and there was no doubt that he had a better eye than Philip for antiques. Philip felt helpless and could only look at Russell. He said courteously, “Sorry for the trouble, Mr. Field.” Russell beamed, waved his hand, and said, “It’s fine. I’ll just treat this as a playdate with Madam Yates.”</p>  <p id = > It was as if Russell was younger than Martha by seven to eight years. As Philip watched Martha and Russell walk into the antique market, his right eye began to twitch. He had a feeling that something bad would happen and</p>  <p id = > thus did not leave immediately. Instead, he stood by the entrance and smoked a cigarette before leaving. Indeed, in less than ten minutes, Philip received a call from Martha. A heated argument could be heard taking place on the other end of the phone. “Philip, come quick! These penniless fools said I smashed one of their blue and white porcelain antiques and want me to pay them thirty million bucks!” Martha said angrily. At the same time, she began fighting fiercely with the owner of the shop.</p>   <h2 id =chapter-227 > Chapter 227</h2>  <p id = > Thirty million bucks? Philip felt helpless. He knew something would happen, but he was not expecting Martha to get herself into such big trouble.</p>  <p id = > “Alright, mom. I’ll be there immediately. Please wait for me.” After Philip said that, he hung up the phone and dashed to the scene. When Philip arrived at the scene, he noticed that they were at a hundred-year-old shop. There was a crowd at the entrance. Some of the people there were waiting in line, trying to sell their old items while some of them were only there for the drama. Nonetheless, their heads could be seen bobbing up and down. There was an argument taking place in the shop, and Philip could hear Martha’s shrieks from outside the place. When Philip entered the shop, he saw Martha accusing the shop owner of bullying his customers. She was talking so fast her saliva was flying all over the place. Additionally, she was accusing the owner of selling fake antiques and scamming people of their money. “I’m not paying! Why should I? What kind of blue and white porcelain vase is this? It’s fake! You just want to scam a woman like me who doesn’t know anything. I’m going to call the cops on you! What you’re doing is extortion</p>  <p id = > and blackmail!” Martha was fuming. It was just a porcelain vase. How dare he ask her to pay thirty million bucks? He had to be bullying her because she did not know anything. He only wanted to scam her. However, Martha was feeling rather guilty as well. It was the man’s shop and behind the owner were two muscular and tattooed men. If Russell had not stopped them, Martha would not have had any say as well. “Mom, what happened?” Philip squeezed through the crowd and asked curiously. Martha glared at Philip.</p>  <p id = > She was mad that he had taken so long to come. Within that period of time, she had been criticized by the people around them. She yelled, “What took you so long? Never mind. Look, this is the tiny vase I accidentally knocked over. They want me to pay thirty million for it, but I don’t care. You stay here and take care of this for me. I think it only has a value of a few</p> <p id = > hundred bucks. I still have to go back to make lunch for your dad.” After saying that, Martha turned around and ran away. If she did not run now, when would she get the chance to run? Philip looked at the smashed porcelain vase on the floor and then at Russell. He asked, “Mr. Field, is it genuine?” Russell said helplessly, “Yeah, it’s a genuine blue and white porcelain vase. The shop owner is a friend of mine. The vase is genuine and the price is just. It is indeed thirty million bucks.” Russell’s heart was broken as well. It was the shop’s showcased item, and the shop owner was a friend of his. Russell had only brought Martha to pick an item. He had not expected Martha to touch and look at everything the moment she stepped foot into the shop.</p>  <p id = > Additionally, Russel had never imagined that Martha would knock over the blue and white porcelain vase. When the shop owner saw that Philip was a reasonable person, he poured out some tea from his dark-red enameled pot, took a sip, and said, “My friend, the blue and white porcelain vase is from the year when Emperor Yongle was in power. I wouldn’t lie to you. It is indeed genuine and worth thirty million bucks. I’ll leave once I get the money. If you won’t pay, I’ll call the cops. It was the most valuable object in our humble, little shop, and your mom just smashed it like that.” Philip sighed. It was a huge price to pay. However, who would have expected</p>  <p id = > Martha to shriek loudly after hearing such an explanation? “Bullsh*t!</p>  <p id = > Emperor Yongle? I say it’s fake! Your shop is scamming its customers! I’ve come across too many people like you who sell fake goods! You’ve been poor for far too long that you’ve gone insane!” When the shop owner heard her words, he could no longer endure it, and his face fell immediately. Did she just say that his shop sold fake goods? He could not take such an insult.</p>  <p id = > In order to do business in the antique market, owners were required to follow a lot of regulations. How could anyone stand being pointed and yelled at by this shrew? “Madam, please look closely. My shop is a hundred years old!</p>  <p id = > We value trust in our industry. I’ve never sold fake goods before. If you keep slandering me like that, this won’t just be about compensation.” The</p> <p id = > shop owner was now mad. He placed his dark-red enameled pot down and took out his phone. He said, “Let just stop arguing about what happened.</p>  <p id = > I’ll just call the cops and let them handle this.” When Martha heard that he was going to call the cops, she started to panic. She knew she could not stay there any longer, so she said to Philip, “Philip, handle this. I’ll… go home first. If you get into any trouble, just take care of it yourself.” The wisest thing to do was to run away! That was what Martha was thinking at the moment. However, could she? She was stopped by the two muscular men at the door. Martha fell to the ground in fear after she saw their muscles and terrifying expressions. Then, she started bawling and shouting, “Everyone, look! They’re going to hit me! They’re going to hit me! This is daylight robbery! They’re scamming their customers and lying to them! The blue and white porcelain vase is a fake, and they want me to pay thirty million bucks!” What else could she do? Of course, she could only throw a huge tantrum. The method had worked countless times for Martha, and it had been time-tested. However, Martha had forgotten that this was not her house. How would they allow her to get away with this? One of the big men grabbed Martha’s collar and dragged her back into the shop as if she was a dead dog. “Let go of me! Let go! They’re hitting me! Murderer!” Martha kept on struggling and yelling. When she saw Philip standing at one side,</p>  <p id = > doing nothing, she yelled hysterically, “Philip, why are you just standing there? Come and hit them for me! Are you going to watch me get hit and do nothing?” She was shrewish and rude. Not to mention, she was causing a huge scene. It was Martha’s self-cultivation as a shrew. Without any other choice, Philip shook his head and asked, “Mom, did he hit you? You broke their vase. Why don’t you own up to your mistake? We can just apologize and pay up. Why do you want to make a fool out of yourself?” Pay up?</p>  <p id = > Martha would definitely refuse! It was thirty million bucks! “Are you insane? Why should I? It’s a fake! A fake!” Martha was extremely shameless now that she had become hysterical.</p>  <h2 id =chapter-228 > Chapter 228</h2>  <p id = > Slap! The shop owner could no longer take it. He looked at his subordinates and then slapped Martha across the face. Immediately, Martha, who had been making threatening gestures and endless pesters, fell silent. Her eyes were filled with rage as she stared at Philip. She did not dare attack the shop owner, so she ran over to Philip and started scratching him shrewishly. She yelled, “How did I get such a useless son-in-law like you? I was slapped and you’re still standing here! You’re just a spineless coward! I’m going to ask Wynn to divorce you!” Philip felt rather helpless, but he did not want to argue about it with her. Hence, he turned around and said to the shop owner,</p>  <p id = > “I’m sorry. We’ll pay for it. Why don’t we talk inside?” The shop owner looked at Russell and nodded. “Alright, you’re quite reasonable, kid.” After that, the few of them went back into the shop. On the other hand, Martha continued to make a scene outside as she hurled extremely nasty comments,</p>  <p id = > “Philip, if you intend to pay for the case, you should pay for it by yourself!</p>  <p id = > This has nothing to do with me nor my family!” However, when Martha saw the cold gazes of the two huge men, she became as timid as a mouse.</p>  <p id = > Consequently, she lowered her head and stood in the corner as she glared at everyone in the room fiercely while mumbling curses. Over on the other side, Philip followed the shop owner into a room located in the shop. “I’m</p>  <p id = > sorry, Mr. Clarke. It’s all my fault, I’m responsible for this.” Russell apologized to Philip the moment they got into the room. The shop owner was shocked by what he heard and asked curiously, “Mr. Field, what are you doing?” Dang! What was going on with Mr. Field? Why was he being so respectful toward the young man? Russell smiled and said, “Tom, this is Mr. Clarke. I mentioned him to you before.” Clank! The shop owner’s heart skipped a beat, and he immediately invited Philip to take a seat. So, he was the top tier nouveau riche who had invested two billion bucks in Russell’s company. A white and blue porcelain vase was nothing to a rich man like</p> <p id = > him. “Um, Mr. Clarke, I’m so sorry. I didn’t know who you were. Why don’t we just disregard the payment for the white and blue porcelain vase?</p>  <p id = > Let’s treat it as a little something from me to you.” The shop owner smiled flatteringly. Philip waved his hand and said, “No, that's a horse of another color. Thirty million is thirty million, and I’m not short of money. Give me your account later, I’ll ask my people to transfer the money to you.” The shop owner looked at Russell and saw the latter nodding. So, he did not decline Philip’s offer. After less than 5 minutes, Philip and the other two men walked out of the room together. Martha was shocked when she saw Philip unharmed. She asked, “You’re alright?” “Why wouldn’t I be?” Philip asked. The shop owner said politely, “Please come back to our shop next time, Mr. Clarke. Let me escort you out.” Philip shook his head and said,</p>  <p id = > “No need.” After he said that, they left the shop. On the way out, Martha looked at Philip as if he was a ghost. However, an opportunity had finally presented itself, so she asked, “Philip, stop! Tell me honestly, do you have a secret stash of money that you’re hiding from Wynn?” A secret stash of money? Philip shook his head and smiled. “Mom, what are you talking about?” Martha chuckled and said, “You’re asking me what I’m talking about? The shop owner kept insisting that we pay him thirty million. How is it possible that he let you go if you didn’t pay?” Philip had to have a secret stash of money, and there was a chance he had a lot of it inside. Nonetheless, thirty million was just impossible. Martha was sure that the white and blue</p>  <p id = > porcelain vase was fake. It was a tactic to scam people of their money. Philip explained, “Mom, the vase was fake. Mr. Field was there, so the owner did not want to look into it anymore. I ended up paying only a hundred thousand bucks.” Philip could only come up with such an explanation. “A hundred thousand?” Martha raised her voice. When she heard a hundred thousand, she felt her heart drop. Martha yelled, “You spendthrift! Where did you get the hundred thousand bucks? You’re still saying you don’t have a secret stash of money! Tell me, where did you get the money from? Do you have a mistress behind Wynn’s back?” Philip had to be having an affair outside.</p>  <p id = > Martha had to find out where he got that hundred thousand bucks from!</p> <p id = > Philip felt helpless, and at the same time, extremely annoyed. Martha was tormenting him too much. “Mom, there’s no such thing. Stop indulging in flights of fancy,” said Philip. Then, he called a car to send Martha home. At the same time, a beautiful woman with a sweet-smelling scent walked over to Philip. In a fit of anger, she slapped Philip across the face in front of Martha. Chloe’s face was stone cold. Her long dress accentuated her perfect figure. Nonetheless, the only thing occupying her mind was her hatred for Philip. “What are you doing?” Philip was enraged. Was she insane? “Philip, you still dare to say you’re not doing anything shameful! Who is this little b*tch?” Martha was furious. She stared at Chloe with resentment in her eyes. The woman looked like a wh*re. She was obviously a homewrecker!</p>  <p id = > That was Martha’s first impression of Chloe. However, something amazing happened right after. “Are you Philip’s mother in law?” Chloe asked as she stared at Martha with an icy expression on her face; her eyes were extremely cold. Martha was terrified. She felt fear in her heart as the other party looked at her like that. She said with a guilty conscience, “Yes, I am. Why? Who are you?” Slap! Chloe lifted her hand and slapped Martha across the face.</p>  <p id = > She said coldly, “Remember, you’re not qualified to ask who I am.”</p>  <h2 id =chapter-229 > Chapter 229</h2>  <p id = > Slap! The slap stunned Martha who was arrogant and unreasonable. Martha became as terrified as a dog. She hid behind Philip and held her face with her hand. She said through gritted teeth, “Who… Who are you? Why did you slap me? My son-in-law is here!” What could she do? She could only rely on Philip at such a time. “I heard that Philip’s mother-in-law is famous for being unreasonable and bossy. Now that I’ve met you, I can confirm that your reputation is fully justified.” Chloe snorted. In Martha’s eyes, Chloe was just an ordinary old woman. Thus, she did not need to take any action herself and someone else would handle her. However, when Martha heard Chloe’s words, she became furious. She was indeed unreasonable, but she was proud of that. She was able to enjoy quite a number of benefits because of her attitude. Nonetheless, she did not feel as proud with Chloe saying it straight to her face. “Even if that were the case, you can’t slap someone willy-nilly.” Martha had lost her overbearing manner. She looked terrified.</p>  <p id = > Martha no longer looked like the person who had been targeting Philip maliciously. Hence, it could be said that she was the type of person who would manipulate the weak and cower at the presence of the strong. Chloe peered at Martha coldly but ignored her. She looked at Philip and said,</p>  <p id = > “Philip, that slap was for you. You’ll never be able to pay for what you did to me in this lifetime!” Philip felt helpless. At the same time, he felt remorseful for what he had done to Chloe. Nonetheless, he would not let Chloe do anything that would hurt Wynn or Mila. “I’m warning you, Chloe.</p>  <p id = > Don’t try to challenge me. You should know how I am.” Philip’s face was dark, and his eyes looked solemn. Chloe snorted and looked at Martha. She said, “Remember, my name is Chloe Sommerset. I’m warning you, behave yourself. Don’t cause Philip any trouble, if not, I’ll never forgive you.” After saying that, Chloe turned around and walked away. Then, she got into a black Benz and left. Once Chloe left, Martha felt as if a huge weight had been lifted from her shoulders. Consequently, she let out a huge sigh of relief. Slap! Before Philip could comprehend what had happened, Martha slapped him across the face. Additionally, she pointed at Philip’s nose and</p> <p id = > yelled, “What are you staring at? What were you doing just now? She was bullying me! Were you dead? Were you so afraid that you couldn’t speak?</p>  <p id = > How did I get such a useless son-in-law like you? I’m so mad!” Martha was seething. Her attitude was horrible. She had lived for so long, and no one had dared lecture her like that before. How shameful! She was fuming!</p>  <p id = > Having yelled angrily at Philip, she turned around to look in the direction where Chloe had left and shouted arrogantly, “Do you think you’re so high up there just because you’re rich? What kind of stupid car are you driving?</p>  <p id = > You little vixen, I’ll kill you when I also have a car like that!” That was how Martha was as a person. She dared not say anything in front of Chloe, and she only dared to talk after the latter had left. Philip’s face was dark. He had been slapped by Martha for no reason. However, he could not do anything to her. “Mom, do you know who she was?” Philip asked coldly. “Why? Who else could she be? Pah, she’s just a homewrecker! Let me tell you, this is not over yet. You have to explain everything to me. What’s your relationship with that homewrecker? Come back home with Wynn tonight and explain everything to me and your dad!” Martha was fuming as she rubbed her swollen face. Her expression was rather shrewd. Philip was getting out of hand. How dare he get himself a mistress behind Wynn’s back. Now, there was a homewrecker in the picture! Philip shook his head helplessly as he smiled bitterly. Martha had such a wild imagination. If he told Martha that Chloe was Miss Sommerset who had given her all the presents, what would her reaction be? Would she still run her mouth and continue to hurl insults at Chloe? Perhaps not. Thus, Philip did not say anything. He would just let some things remain the way they were. Someone like Martha would never learn unless she suffered some sort of punishment. After he parted ways with Martha, Philip went to his office to supervise his employees. He would not be a competent boss if he was always absent from work. That day, he stayed in the office until late hours. Subsequently, he received a call from Wynn who then told him that his in-laws were asking for them to go home.</p>  <p id = > Philip knew immediately that it was about what had happened that evening.</p>  <p id = > Martha was going to criticize him violently. He did not have a choice.</p> <p id = > Hence, Philip sat in Agnes’ car and returned to the old manor.</p>  <p id = > Coincidentally, he ran into Wynn at the entrance, and the three of them greeted each other. “Agnes, swing by our place whenever you’re free.”</p>  <p id = > Wynn smiled and waved her hand. Agnes replied politely and left. After Agnes left, Wynn folded her arms in front of her chest and wore a jealous expression on her face. She looked at Philip coldly and asked, “Is it nice being in the same car as Agnes?” “Not bad,” Philip blurted out. He had not noticed the expression on Wynn’s face. Smack! Wynn kicked Philip in the shin and pinched his ear. She said sternly, “Well, well, Philip. You’re frolicking all over the place after only a few days of me not paying attention to you, huh? Does it feel good?” Philip was dumbstruck and finally figured out that Wynn was jealous. He grinned and laughed like an idiot. He said,</p>  <p id = > “No, it doesn’t.” Wynn rolled her eyes at him before finally stopping.</p>  <h2 id =chapter-230 > Chapter 230</h2>  <p id = > When Wynn arrived at the entrance, she did not go in immediately. Instead, she looked at Philip anxiously and said, “Philip, something must be wrong judging by the way mom asked us to come home. If she yells at you or hits you, you… you can fight back.” Wynn was feeling helpless toward her mother’s unreasonableness. Before this, she would close one eye to the abuse Martha inflicted on Philip because she was still contemplating whether she wanted to divorce him or not. However, it was different now.</p>  <p id = > Wynn had started to feel a long lost love between her and Philip. Philip was taken aback. He shook his head and said, “it’s fine. Your mom is my mom.</p>  <p id = > I won’t lose anything from the insults or punches.” Wynn looked at Philip.</p>  <p id = > Her eyes were twinkling under the moonlight. Out of the blue. She tiptoed and kissed Philip on the lips. Then, she backed away quickly. “Stop overthinking. That’s your reward that I’m giving you in advance,” Wynn said while blushing. Shortly after, she made her way into the yard and knocked on the door. The four of them sat inside the living room. Martha</p>  <p id = > was fuming. She asked Philip in an interrogative tone, “Philip, your father, me, and Wynn are all here. You should tell us the truth. Who was that vixen this morning? Is she your mistress?” Mistress? All of a sudden, there was dead silence in the room. Wynn’s reaction was the most genuine as she looked at Philip in disbelief. Had he been having an external affair? Charles only knew what Martha was trying to do now. He got up and angrily pointed at Philip with burning rage in his chest. He roared, “Philip, do you have a mistress outside of this family?” How dare his useless son-in-law do something so utterly heartless? How would he face his neighbors if word got out? What would happen to his daughter, Wynn? Philip knew that it was coming, so, he explained, “Mom, you’re mistaken. She’s not my mistress.”</p>  <p id = > Martha was still unconvinced. She continued angrily, “Then tell everyone in the room who that woman was. How did she know you and why can’t you</p> <p id = > pay her back for what you did?” Philip looked at Wynn helplessly and asked Martha, “Mom, do you really want to know?” “Rubbish! Tell us now.</p>  <p id = > If you don’t give us an appropriate explanation, you should divorce Wynn!</p>  <p id = > Leave the marriage with nothing!” Martha looked at Philip with a grim look on her face as she snorted. The guy in front of her had enough money to pay for the stupid vase. So, he had to have a secret stash of money! Martha would not let him go so easily until she had taken everything from him. After pondering for a while, Philip said calmly, “She’s Miss Sommerset, the one who sent you all those gifts.” Crack! Martha’s words became stuck in her throat. What? Miss Sommerset? No way! “What nonsense are you spewing?” Martha’s face was in disbelief. Philip did not want to explain further. He said, “Mom, I’ll return everything to her tomorrow. There are some things that I can’t tell you, and you shouldn’t ask me about them as well. There’s really nothing between us.” “What? Return everything?”</p>  <p id = > Martha was livid. She got up, pointed at Philip’s nose, and shrieked angrily,</p>  <p id = > “Who are you to ask me to return everything? She gave me those things, so they’re mine now.” Martha started yelling hysterically. Eventually. Philip was kicked out of the Johnston Manor in under 10 minutes. Philip and Wynn</p>  <p id = > looked at each other helplessly before they decided to call a car to go to the hospital. They had to stay by Mila’s side for the next two days. “Philip, what are you going to do about Chloe?” Wynn’s back was toward Philip as she laid on the hospital bed. She asked with her eyes closed. Philip’s arm was draped across Wynn’s waist as he said, “I’ll take care of it. Mila and you are my everything. I will love you and Mila no matter what happens.” Wynn stirred and smiled sweetly. The early morning the next day, Philip hired a few movers to go to the Johnston Manor. “What are you doing? Who asked you to come here? Get out!” Martha started yelling. Those people had begun moving her things the very moment they entered the house. Additionally, they were all moving the gifts Chloe had given her. How could Martha remain calm? Martha was furious when she spotted Philip smoking calmly outside the house. She ran over to him to slap him. She yelled, “Philip, you rebellious rascal! This is my house! Tell them to</p> <p id = > stop now!” However, Philip caught her hand mid-air. “Martha, I’ve constantly endured your torment because you’re an elder to me. However, you’ve been an intolerable bully!” Philip said coldly and swung his hand. Martha was stunned. Philip had never spoken to her like this before. Was he crazy? Martha was seething. How dare he disrespect her in front of everyone? It was her home, and she was his mother-in-law. What status did she have considering the fact that Philip dared to talk to her like that? “Philip, are you insane? Is that how you’re going to speak to me? Do you even respect me as your mother-in-law?” Martha glared at Philip angrily. Nevertheless, Philip ignored her and walked away after taking a call. It was from Theo. He told Philip that Monkey from Yates Village had contacted him. “M-Mr. Clarke, I’m Monkey. I have something urgent to tell you,” Monkey sounded extremely anxious over the phone. “Tell me. What happened?” Philip asked calmly.</p>  <p id = > “Mr. Clarke, you have to watch out for Eric. He brought a few men to the city to look for your wife,” Monkey said anxiously. Eric was in town? He had come for Wynn? What was the guy planning to do?</p>  <h2 id =chapter-231 > Chapter 231</h2>  <p id = > After he hung up, Philip felt anxious, so he called Wynn. “Wynnie, what are you doing?” Philip asked. Wynn replied, “I’m in the office. There are a lot of annoying things going on. Turner's Hospital did not sign the contract with us.” Wynn was in her office facing a huge stack of documents. She was extremely irritated. The contract was not signed because Chloe had barged in and made a scene during the meeting. In the end, Derrick contacted another party. Nevertheless, Derrick told the employees not to worry as the company would reconsider their contract again. Hence, the heavy burden fell onto Wynn’s shoulder in an instant. She was the VP after all, and Derrick had assigned the task to her. Thus, she had to be successful in securing a collaboration with Turner’s hospital branch in Riverdale. What Wynn did not know was that Chloe was the one messing things up secretly.</p>  <p id = > At the moment, Beacon Pharmaceutical’s boss was Chloe. The reason the collaboration was unsuccessful was that Chloe had pressured them to do so by using her family’s name in Capital City. In short, Chloe was creating all</p> <p id = > kinds of trouble for Wynn. Women were indeed magical and terrifying creatures. When Philip heard that, he replied quickly, “Alright, I got it.”</p>  <p id = > After hanging up the phone, Philip called Henry personally. “Professor Turner, why was the contract with Beacon not signed?” Henry replied respectfully, “It wasn’t? I don’t know. I ordered my employees to handle it.</p>  <p id = > Mr. Clarke, don’t worry, I’ll call them and ask about it.” Philip did not say anything. Five minutes later, he received a phone call from Henry. Henry said, “Mr. Clarke, don’t worry. I already asked my people to settle the contract with Beacon now. I think I will receive a reply soon.” “Alright, thank you, Professor Turner,” Philip said politely. At the same time, under the building where Beacon Pharmaceutical was located, a black Audi A8L</p>  <p id = > could be seen speeding over. It was Director Stanley from Turner’s Hospital. He had come to Beacon Pharmaceutical himself. “VP Johnston, please go to the meeting room now. Mr. Derrick is looking for you. I heard</p>  <p id = > that Director Stanley from Turner is here to talk to you about the collaboration.” Mindy had run to the VP’s office and was ecstatic. Wynn was still worried about the matter. The moment she heard the news, she asked quickly, “Really? Director Stanley is here?” “Yeah, go take a look.</p>  <p id = > They’re asking for you to sign the contract.” Mindy was excited. The company had been discussing their contract with Turner for a long time now, and it was finally going to be sorted out. Mindy was genuinely happy for Wynn because Wynn often looked after her like a big sister. Having stared into space for a while, Wynn finally came back to her senses. She looked over at the phone on her desk. Had Philip done something to help her? That was because not long ago, she was still on the phone talking to Philip. Nevertheless, she thought about it for a while and eventually dismissed her suspicions. Maybe not. Turner’s Hospital was too prestigious.</p>  <p id = > Even if Philip had some sort of relationship with Professor Turner, he would not have the right to have a say in their contract. After all, the benefits of the industry and company she was representing were on the line. Wynn suppressed her urge to call Philip and ask him about it. She was wearing a cream-colored shirt and a red skirt. She stood up and quickly</p> <p id = > made her way to the meeting room as her white heels clicked against the floor. In the meeting room, Wynn saw Director Stanley. They shook hands and exchanged pleasantries politely. “Director Stanley, have you made up your mind?” Wynn asked. Director Stanley adjusted his glasses and smiled. “VP</p>  <p id = > Johnston, we’ve concluded our investigation and observation. We can sign the contract with your company now.” Having said that, Director Stanley did not waste any time and signed the contract immediately.</p>  <p id = > “Congratulations, VP Johnston. I hope our collaboration will go smoothly.”</p>  <p id = > Director Stanley stood up and shook Wynn’s hand once more. “Director Stanley, thank you for trusting Beacon. We won’t disappoint you,” Wynn said courteously. There was a smile on her face. After sending Director Stanley and his people off, Wynn stumbled slightly. She could not believe that they actually signed the contract. It was a contact worth fifty million</p>  <p id = > bucks! “Congratulations, VP Johnston!” “VP Johnston, you’re so amazing! Where are you going to treat us for dinner tonight?” “It’s finally done, VP</p>  <p id = > Johnston. It would be too mean if you don’t treat us to dinner.” The company became lively immediately as everyone stood up to clap and congratulate Wynn. Some even took out bottles of champagne and party poppers. Derrick joined in as well. After saying something congratulatory, he suggested,</p>  <p id = > “Alright, tonight, we’ll have dinner at Arc de Triumph, what does everyone think?” “Oh! Thank you, Mr. Hall!” Everyone cheered excitedly. Wynn was so happy that she forgot about the date she had with Philip that night.</p>  <h2 id =chapter-232 > Chapter 232</h2>  <p id = > At the same time, Derrick’s phone rang. He looked at the number and ran to one side politely before answering it. “M-Miss Sommerset, how can I help you?” “Did Wynn Johnston manage to secure the contract with Turner’s branch?” A cold voice asked. “Yes, Miss Sommerset. Director Stanley from Turner came here personally and signed it just now.” The back of Derrick’s head was drenched in sweat; his legs were trembling from fear. Chloe Sommerset was very difficult to deal with. As of now, Derrick was the only one who knew that Chloe was the new boss of the company. He could guess that everything Chloe did was related to Wynn. It could even be related to Philip. “Got it.” Slam! She hung up the phone. Derrick started to panic. He did not know what she was thinking. He calmed himself down before returning to the office. At that time, everyone was still discussing what to eat in Arc de Triumph that night. Then, Wynn received a phone call. It was from Eric. “Hello, Wynn. Where are you? I’m at Riverdale Plaza. Come pick me up.” Eric’s tone was extremely arrogant, and he was speaking as if he was ordering his servant. Wynn was surprised. There was a stunned expression on her face as she said coldly, “Eric? Why are you here?” Why was Eric there? “Wynn, I’m here to enjoy myself of course! Why? Don’t you want to entertain me?” Eric was at Riverdale Plaza. He was wearing a pair of sunglasses and chewing on a piece of gum. He looked very stylish in</p>  <p id = > his floral shirt. Nevertheless, he looked wanton and unrestrained at the same time. He was leaning against a remodeled Benz sport’s car that was red in color and toying with his car keys. He looked cool and flashy. Naturally, he attracted the attention of a few pretty girls that even came to flirt with him.</p>  <p id = > On one side, there were a few other remodeled sport’s cars as well, namely Mazdas, BMWs, and Mitsubishis. There was an unbridled man standing at the side of each car. Additionally, there were two beautiful women who were dressed stylishly next to them. Their hair was in braids, and they were wearing earrings, nose rings, boots, booty shorts, and crop tops. They were typical hedonistic children of rich parents. The way they dressed made it seem that they were obviously into cars. Wynn pondered for a while before saying, “Okay, I’ll pick you up later.” Eric hung up the phone and looked at</p> <p id = > the clear blue sky. A smirk appeared on his face. He snapped his fingers and smiled at his gang. “Showtime.” They looked at each other and nodded their heads. After about 15 minutes, Wynn drove to Riverdale Plaza herself.</p>  <p id = > There were a lot of cars parked at the plaza. However, she did not see Eric.</p>  <p id = > Just as she was about to call him and ask where he was… Suddenly! She heard the rumbling of a motor. Wynn turned her head and saw a red Benz sport’s car charging at her at a speed of 100 miles per hour. Eric was sitting in the car, and there was an eerie smile on his face. At that moment, Wynn was stunned. She stood motionless and watched in a daze as the red Benz sport’s car charged toward her. Moreover, her ears began to buzz from the rumbling of the motor. Only when the Benz sport’s car was one meter away from Wynn did the car swiftly drift beside her and circle her. Finally, it stopped with a loud buzz. Eric pushed open the car door, got out of it, and held it open with his hand on its frame. Then, he removed his sunglasses with his other hand and said provocatively, “Hey, Wynn, were you scared stupid?” Hahaha! Laughter sounded behind Wynn. Eric’s friends began walking toward Wynn and looking at her from head to toe without the slightest scruple. A few of the men laughed and said shamelessly, “Damn, Eric. Your cousin is hot. Look at her body.” “Hahaha, this chick is not bad.</p>  <p id = > She’s my type. I can’t wait, Eric. What about a hundred thousand per night?</p>  <p id = > Would that be okay?” One of the men that had his hair in braids smirked deviously. Eric shook his head and said, “Slim, you’d have to talk to my cousin about the price. I have no problem if she agrees.” ‘That face is even softer than the face of a celebrity.’ Slap! Wynn finally came back to her senses out of fear, and she slapped the man that had his hair in braids heavily across the face. She yelled, “Did your mother never teach you how to speak like a human being?”</p>  <h2 id =chapter-233 > Chapter 233</h2>  <p id = > Eric had not expected Wynn’s sudden slap. The man with braids was stunned. After coming back to his senses, he yelled, “F*ck! You b*tch! How dare you hit me! Do you want to die?” Braids was furious! He had never been slapped by a woman in public before. Slap! He lifted his hand and returned Wynn a slap. The slap landed on Wynn’s face. Consequently, her right cheek instantly became swollen and started to turn red. “B*tch! How dare you slap my f*cking face!” Braids was fuming. He glared at Wynn angrily and then grabbed her arm. “Let go of me! If not, I’ll call the cops!”</p>  <p id = > Wynn struggled and screamed. However, it was to no avail. The seven to eight people around her were all Eric’s friends. However, at the moment, they were just spectators. They only watched on coldly as the scene unfolded. They were well aware that Eric wanted to teach that woman a lesson. “Scream more! Struggle more! You little b*tch, slap me again, I dare you! If I don’t teach you a lesson today, I’ll just stop existing altogether!”</p>  <p id = > Braids swore as he talked, and there was a devious smirk on his face. He lifted his chin as he looked at everyone; he seemed extremely arrogant. Eric was currently leaning against his red Benz sport’s car and was smoking a cigarette. He watched on coldly and did nothing. On the contrary, Eric felt extremely pleased with himself as he watched Wynn get bullied. That woman deserves this! “Eric, do you know what you’re doing?” Wynn was pressed against the hood of the car by Braids. Her face was filled with rage,</p>  <p id = > and her eyes were red. Eric chuckled heartlessly and patted Wynn’s face. He said, “Wynn, of course, I know what I’m doing. Why? Are you scared?</p>  <p id = > Don’t you have a good husband? Come, tell him to get here. If you want to leave here unharmed, Philip will have to kneel and kowtow to me, understand?” Eric added, “Wynn, we’re family. Of course, I wouldn’t cause</p> <p id = > trouble for you. As long as you tell Philip to get over here, kneel, and kowtow to me, I’ll let you go. Think about it, Philip is just a worthless bum.</p>  <p id = > Plus, he’s an outsider.” After he said that, Eric signaled Braids to take action. Braids had been waiting for a long time. He licked his lips and let out a perverted laugh. Then, he pinched Wynn’s smooth cheek. Wynn gritted her teeth. Her eyes were filled with tears. She struggled furiously and yelled hoarsely, “Eric Yates, you’ll die a horrible death!” If she asked Philip to come over, Eric would definitely not let him go easily. Wynn could not do that. Hence, she bit her red lips angrily and closed her eyes. In her ears, she could hear Braids’ perverted laugh. She was ready to endure all of it.</p>  <p id = > Wynn would not ask Philip to come over even if it meant she would be dishonored. She knew very clearly that Eric’s target was Philip. If Philip were to come, he would be finished. Eric looked at Braids and his gang.</p>  <p id = > Then, he took out a pill from his pocket. He did not say anything and put his hand around Wynn’s neck before forcing her to swallow it. “Cough cough!”</p>  <p id = > Wynn’s eyes were red after coughing so violently. She stared at Eric and his gang and yelled, “What did you feed me?” Eric chuckled coldly and said,</p>  <p id = > “A very exciting pill, of course.” After he said that, Eric waved his hand coldly. Subsequently, Braids and the other men held Wynn as the latter’s legs went limp. They then got into their cars and forcefully kidnapped her away from the plaza.</p>  <h2 id =chapter-234 > Chapter 234</h2>  <p id = > Eric had gotten the pill overseas. No woman could stay conscious under its</p>  <p id = > effects. Inside the car, four men stared at Wynn who had just started to feel</p> <p id = > the effects of the pill. She looked very alluring as she bit her lip and pressed</p>  <p id = > down on her skirt. The car sped to a hotel. The few of them got out of the car and carried Wynn into a room. At the same time, Philip had been trying to call Wynn frantically. However, no one ever answered her phone. In the end, her phone was switched off. Oh no, something terrible must have happened! That was Philip’s first instinct. Hence, he called Mindy immediately. “Mindy, where did Wynn do? Why isn’t she picking up her phone?” Mindy was in the office discussing what to eat with her colleagues.</p>  <p id = > She replied, “VP Johnston left 20 minutes ago. I think she went to the plaza.</p>  <p id = > Oh right, she went to pick up her cousin, Eric.” Eric? Philip was beginning to feel more and more anxious. He hung up the phone and called Theo. “Tell me where Eric Yates is! Hurry!” Theo replied respectfully, “Mr. Clarke, I’ll ask my people to look for him. Don’t worry!” How could he not worry?</p>  <p id = > Philip did not say anything else and immediately hung up the phone. He then called Eric. Almost instantly, the call connected. Eric chuckled coldly and said, “Oh, isn’t this my cousin-in-law? Why are you calling me?” “Eric!</p>  <p id = > Where is Wynn?” Philip roared. He was extremely mad; rage had enveloped his entire body. If Eric crossed the line, Philip would teach him a lesson so harsh that the former would never forget. Additionally, he would make the Yates disappear from Riverdale and from the face of the earth! “Philip, be nicer to me. I won’t be able to remember if you continue being that angry at me.” Eric was drinking with his men at a bar. They were each hugging a girl in each of their arms while having the time of their lives. Hence, Philip eventually managed to find them. Hahaha! His plan had worked! Philip suppressed the anger in his heart. He was fearless as he</p> <p id = > yelled, “Eric, tell me, where is Wynn? I’m warning you. If anything happens to Wynn, you’ll regret this forever, Eric Yates. The Yates will pay horribly for whatever you do!” Eric was enraged. “F*ck! Philip, Wynn is with me now, so who are you to talk to me like that?” Eric was livid. He was not expecting a good-for-nothing like Philip to yell at him. How would he preserve his dignity?</p>  <p id = > “Philip, I can only tell you that Wynn must be having the time of her life right now. Four men! Ah, right, it’s been five minutes. I wonder which step</p>  <p id = > they’re at now. Iceland Hotel Room 3088. If you manage to get there in time, you might be able to witness something exciting.” Eric laughed shamelessly. His eyes and lips were filled with malice. Boom! A clap of thunder struck Philip’s heart. “Eric Yates, you’re digging your own grave!”</p>  <p id = > Philip yelled angrily. His eyes were wide with anger. ‘Damn you, Eric Yates.’ Eric was seriously asking to die. Nevertheless, Philip did not have time to seek revenge on Eric. Thus, he called Theo immediately and told him to order his people who were nearby Iceland Hotel to get there immediately. At the same time, he took his company’s BMW bike and sped over to Iceland Hotel. Over on the other side, after Philip had hung up the phone, Eric chuckled coldly with a grim expression on his face. He said,</p>  <p id = > “Hehe, have a nice day.” At the same time, a figure pushed the door to the private room open and walked inside. He said with a cold chuckle, “Eric, you promised me you wouldn’t hurt Wynn. You’d only cripple Philip.” Eric looked at the man who was now seated opposite him and asked curiously,</p>  <p id = > “Juan, I don’t understand. Do you like my cousin that much? Philip used to be your best friend in the past, and now, you’re so savage for doing this to him.” Two days ago, Juan found Eric and told him he had a plan to exact revenge on Philip. Naturally, Eric accepted his offer happily. The only thing he did not understand was how Juan who used to be pretty wealthy had become so down and out. When Eric asked him about it, the latter refused to speak. Juan’s eyes were dark, and there was a grim smile on his face. He did not say anything and instead only drank some wine before leaving. He looked desolate, and coldness could be felt radiating from his back. After Juan left, Eric kicked the coffee table and roared, “F*ck! How dare he put</p> <p id = > on airs with me!” Eric was not happy with how Juan had acted and felt like he had been looked down u[on. He took out his phone and called Braids.</p>  <p id = > “Go with the original plan. Have your way with her.” ‘Do not hurt Wynn?</p>  <p id = > ‘Who are you, Juan Parker? ‘You’re just a piece of trash in a dire state!’ On Philip’s end, after arriving at Iceland Hotel, he ran to Room 3088. He kicked the door open without thinking twice. Bang! After the door was kicked open,</p>  <p id = > Philip rushed in. When he saw what was happening, the rage in his body was ignited, and his eyes became completely bloodshot. “Go to hell! All of you!” His roar filled the entire room.</p>  <h2 id =chapter-235 > Chapter 235</h2>  <p id = > Philip was triggered by what he saw. His eyes went red and he was livid!</p>  <p id = > Wynn’s hands were being tied to the frame of the bed, and she was moaning in discomfort. Additionally, there was a faint handprint on her cheek, and there was blood on the corner of her lips. Philip was fuming. He ran over and kicked Braids in the stomach with all his might. Bam! Braids flew backward after being kicked by Philip, and the former crashed into the nightstand. It has to be said that Braids’ head was the one that hit the nightstand. Consequently, his head started bleeding, and he howled in pain.</p>  <p id = > The other three men were shocked upon seeing Philip’s arrival. However, they quickly came back to their senses and took out bats and knives from under the bed. They had planned for him to come! It was a trap. A trap for Philip to fall into! Wynn was tied to the bed; she had bit her lip until it had started bleeding. Her eyes were filled with tears as she tried her best to stay conscious. Wynn watched as the three men surrounded Philip. She struggled to yell, “P-Philip, run! Run now!” Even now, she was still worried about Philip. Nevertheless, the next moment, Philip was seen punching, kicking, and grabbing their knives with his bare hands. Evidently, the three of them were eventually defeated and knocked unconscious on the floor. Peter snatched a baseball bat one of them was holding and smashed it down into the person’s head. Smash! Blood started pouring out from the person’s head.</p>  <p id = > That person clutched his bloody head as he fell to the floor. Subsequently, he curled up his body and let out a cry of pain! The other two looked at each other after retrieving their weapons and decided to team u. They charged at Philip as they shouted at the top of their lungs. However, in the end, they were defeated in less than a minute. Two loud thuds. The two of them flew backward and fell to the floor. Their bodies continued to twitch as they</p>  <p id = > drifting in and out of consciousness. Then, Philip slowly walked over to Braids who was leaning against the nightstand. He glared at Braids coldly</p> <p id = > as the latter stood there limply, clutching his head and groaning in pain.</p>  <p id = > Bam! He kicked Braids in the chest once again, and the sound of the latter’s ribs breaking was heard. A scream of agony. Braids passed out instantly.</p>  <p id = > “P-Philip.” Philip reacted quickly and threw the bloody bat onto the floor.</p>  <p id = > His bloodshot eyes returned to normal slowly, and he ran to untie Wynn.</p>  <p id = > However, the next second, Wynn could no longer control herself. She pounced at Philip ‘aggressively’ and climbed into his arms. She latched herself onto Philip like an octopus. Wynn had completely lost her mind. Her entire body was burning. Philip was shocked. He turned around and pressed her against the bed. At this time, Theo and his people had arrived. They were completely shocked by what they saw. “Drag them out!” Philip roared. Theo and his men dragged the four men on the floor outside and then closed the door behind him. Theo would guard the door himself. Two rows of men dressed in black stood neatly on the left and right sides of the door. They were both five meters away from the door!</p>  <h2 id =chapter-236 > Chapter 236</h2>  <p id = > Eric was enjoying himself at the bar. He was extremely pleased with himself at the moment as he finally managed to get back at that little b*tch, Wynn Johnston. Not to mention, Philip had to be very beaten up by now. Eric took out his phone and called Braids. However, no one picked up. He smirked shamelessly and muttered, “I guess it’s going well. I wasn’t expecting Wynn to be such a little wh*re. It’s been so long and she still isn’t done yet.” As Eric thought about it, he proceeded to flirt with the pretty lady next to him.</p>  <p id = > However, at this moment. Bam! The door of the private room was kicked open violently. Four muscular men in suits barged in. Tiger glared coldly at Eric who was sitting on the sofa and currently being overwhelmed with lust.</p>  <p id = > Tiger boomed, “Eric!” Eric turned his head and saw that someone had barged in. He was fuming as he got up, pointed at Tiger, and shouted, “Who</p>  <p id = > the f*ck are you? F*ck off!” In his family, Eric was the king. Thus, he was used to being arrogant and unreasonable. Tiger snorted and forcefully punched him! Crack! That was the sound of Eric’s nose having been broken.</p>  <p id = > Eric fell backward as blood poured out of his nose. His brain began buzzing as well. “F*ck! H-How dare you punch me! So you know who I am? I am Eric Yates from the Yates Family! My grandfather is Bob Yates, and my father is Samson Yates! You’re all dead meat!” Eric clutched his nose and yelled hysterically as his eyes grew wide. “I don’t care who your father or grandfather is. We’re after you!” Tiger said coldly. Tiger waved his hand, and two of his men grabbed Eric. They then twisted Eric’s arms behind his back. Eric struggled and howled in pain. “Let go of me! I am one of the Yates! My dad knows Theo Zander! Theo Zander even attended my grandpa’s birthday party! You’re asking to die if you dare catch me!” Slap!</p>  <p id = > Tiger was starting to get annoyed by his yapping, so he slapped Eric across the face. Consequently, Eric immediately became obedient. Over in the</p> <p id = > hotel room, Wynn had finally been satisfied. Her face was red as she laid in Philip’s arms. The atmosphere of the room had not dissipated, and their amorous mood was still in the air. Wynn’s eyes were wide as she stared into blank space. Philip said, “Don’t go home. Go stay with Mila.” “What about you?” Wynn lifted her head and asked. The scene of Philip barging into the room was still replaying itself in Wynn’s head. She dared not ask. “I have some things to take care of. You should go back first. Mila’s having her surgery tomorrow.” Philip’s tone had turned cold out of nowhere, and his eyes had also begun glinting ominously. Wynn could feel it. She looked at Philip and pondered for a while. Finally, she said, “Be careful. Don’t cause any trouble.” Philip kissed Wynn lightly on the forehead and said, “Alright, I’ll listen to you.” “Right, Philip, why are you so good at fighting? You never told me about it before.” Wynn lifted her head and asked out of the blue. Her eyes were twinkling curiously. “I realize that I can’t seem to figure you out anymore. Are your parents really restaurant owners?” Philip’s fighting moves were like those seen in the movies. He was so amazing! Oh</p>  <p id = > no. Wynn had begun suspecting him. Should he tell her? Philip inhaled sharply, got up, and put on his clothes. After cleaning up, he bid farewell to Wynn and left the room. Theo and his men were standing outside reverently and respectfully. They only removed their hands that were on their ears when they saw Philip walk out. “Mr. Clarke, he has been retained. You can tell us what to do with him anytime,” Theo said deferentially. Philip nodded and said, “Ask someone to send a set of clothes inside.” After that, Philip left the hotel with Theo and his men. He got into Theo’s Mayback and took off to a sport’s arena. Inside the car, Philip’s eyes were icy. However, a fire was burning in his chest. ‘Eric Yates, I’m coming.’ ‘I warned you. You’ll pay greatly for what you’ve done!”</p>  <h2 id =chapter-237 > Chapter 237</h2>  <p id = > The Maybach headed directly to the stadium. At the moment, the outside of the stadium was crawling with henchmen in black suits and dark sunglasses.</p>  <p id = > They were each standing solemnly with their hands behind their backs.</p>  <p id = > When the car pulled over at the entrance, one of the henchmen immediately stepped forward, opened the door of the car, and greeted respectfully, “Mr.</p>  <p id = > Clarke.” About twenty to thirty henchmen in the area followed that person’s cue as they each bowed down and shouted respectfully, “Mr. Clarke!” The volume of their voices was staggering! Philip got out of the car, his cold demeanor and anger seemed to be suppressed in his eyes. With quick steps, he made his way toward the arena. Theo followed closely from behind, ready to deal with the aftermath. As soon as Philip entered the stadium, he heard Eric shouting hysterically. “Let go of me! My name is Eric Yates. I belong to the Yates’ family! If you don’t release me at once, my grandfather won’t let you off! “My father knows Theo Zander. He’s the Underground King of Riverdale! You had better let go of me now! “And you, you should kneel and beg for my forgiveness! Otherwise, I’ll ask Theo to take care of you!” The arrogant Eric could not stop yelling brazenly. Even with his arms tied behind his back and pressed against the seat, he was still acting</p>  <p id = > obnoxiously. Why? Because his grandfather was Bob Yates, and he was a member of the Yates family. His father was Samson Yates, and he was on good terms with Theo Zander. Who would dare lay a finger on him? Those bunch of people would be courting their own deaths! Despite all that, Tiger’s expression was indifferent as he stood before Eric. It was as if Tiger was looking at a moron. With a swing of his arm, a slap landed on Eric’s face, knocking out two of his teeth. Tiger shouted, “So much nonsense. You don’t even know how and why you’re going to die. Such an idiot.” Eric glared vehemently at Tiger, spat a mouthful of blood, and sneered. “D*mn fatso, I’ll remember you. You’re finished! I’ll shatter your teeth personally!”</p> <p id = > In fact, Eric became a little flustered. When he was brought to the place earlier, he had observed his surroundings. There were many people, and all of them were henchmen in black suits. Such a setup could not have been accomplished by an unknown person in Riverdale. Eric Yates had just arrived on the same day and he had not offended anyone. The only people he had provoked were that little b*tch Wynn Johnston and Philip Clarke.</p>  <p id = > Could it be Philip? Impossible! How could that piece of trash command such a huge force! If that good-for-nothing really was behind it, Eric would eat sh*t! However, the very next second, Eric saw a familiar silhouette appear at the entrance. When Eric saw the person’s figure, he was dumbstruck! This… how could this be possible?! It was Philip Clarke. Why was he there? Wait a minute! The person behind him was Theo Zander! It was Theo! Instantly, Eric ignored Philip and instead began to frantically shout at Theo for help, “Theo, it’s me. I’m Eric Yates from the Yates family.</p>  <p id = > My father is Samson Yates. Tell your men to capture them. They dared beat me up, they’re courting death!” Nevertheless, no matter how much Eric shouted, Theo was unmoved. With a cold expression on his face, he stood behind Philip, looking at Eric as if he were already a dead man. The next instant, under Eric’s shocked gaze. Philip approached him one step at a time.</p>  <p id = > Philip was full of anger as his eyes reflected hell’s bitter chill. Bam! He was struck by Philip’s knee! Philip had struck Eric’s chin with deadly force!</p>  <p id = > Crack! A crisp sound was heard! A few of Eric’s teeth were knocked out of his mouth, and he spat out mouthfuls of blood! The sudden excruciating pain made Eric shudder all over! The pain! The gut-wrenching pain! He had not managed to close his mouth in time when he was struck. Consequently, his teeth bit off a small piece of his tongue, and his whole mouth was now full of viscous blood! “Argh!” An agonizing cry was heard! With his head down, and blood dripping from his mouth, Eric snared as he stared viciously at Philip with his bloodshot eyes. “Philip! You dare… you actually dare lay a hand on me! I want you dead! Your whole family is dead!” “My whole family?” Philip said coldly and then looked down upon Eric like the King of the Underworld. Thump! Another kick! This time, it landed on Eric’s chest. His whole body, including the chair he was sitting</p> <p id = > in, toppled over and hit the ground! Then, Philip quickly stepped forward, grabbed hold of the chair, raised it, and slammed it into Eric! The wooden chair broke into pieces! Eric experienced the most heart-wrenching pain that came from his very soul. He would remember it for the rest of his life. “No, no more. I was wrong, I was wrong!” Eric abandoned his previous persona that was arrogant. He fell to the ground and began to beg for mercy with great difficulty as he tried to crawl away. However. Philip stood stoically in front of him, raised his leg, and stomped on his hand! In an instant, screams akin to dying pigs were heard throughout the stadium. About ten minutes later, Eric was limp on the ground like a dead dog. Theo passed a towel to Philip to clean his hands. Philip took it, wiped his hands, and threw it on Eric.</p>  <p id = > Fishing out a cigarette from his pocket, Philip lit it and took a deep puff. He then glared at Eric who was on the ground, “Eric Yates, now, do you know what the consequences of provoking me are?” Eric had been beaten beyond recognition. With his body trembling all over, he opened his heavily bruised eyes with great difficulty and whimpered as he asked, “You… who are you?”</p>  <h2 id =chapter-238 > Chapter 238</h2>  <p id = > Eric had never imagined that a piece of trash like Philip would lash out at him like that! He was simply unscrupulous! Also, why was Theo standing next to him so respectfully? All the events that had happened almost caused Eric to suffer a mental breakdown. Why? Was he not a good-for-nothing!</p>  <p id = > Philip thought for a moment before replying calmly, “I’m someone you can’t afford to offend. Remember this, the Yates family is nothing more than an ant in my eyes. Don’t try to challenge me, otherwise, I won’t think twice about removing the Yates from the face of this earth.” Philip had the urge to remove the Yates that day, but he recalled the words Wynn had said to him. Do not cause trouble. Therefore, Philip held back and only taught Eric a lesson. If Eric remained unrepentant after this, then, there would be no longer any reason for the Yates family to exist. Eric lied on the ground as he sneered and said, “Philip Clarke, it seems that I’ve underestimated you.</p>  <p id = > You’ve been holding back all this while.” Eric could not figure it out. How could useless trash like him be so formidable? Philip merely chuckled and left after saying a few parting words, “I’ll give you a piece of advice. Stay away from Wynn and don’t try any funny business again. Otherwise, you’ll end up miserably.” With that said, Philip turned around and left. Theo nodded to Tiger and personally saw Philip out. In the stadium, only Tiger and the henchmen remained. They all stared at Eric coldly and sneered. Eric felt chills all over his body. Being stared at by a group of burly men made him fear for his life. “You… What are you going to do? I’m Bob Yates’s grandson, and my father is Samson Yates! You can’t do this to me! You can’t!” Eric watched on hopelessly as Tiger and his men walked over toward him with a sack and rope. They placed him in the sack, tied it up, and quickly loaded him into a van. Philip headed toward the hospital as soon as he left the stadium. Theo had taken care of the men Eric had brought with him.</p>  <p id = > Theo had disposed of them in front of a hospital because their limbs were broken. After arriving at the door of the ward, Philip took a deep breath and</p> <p id = > pushed the door open. He was greeted by a heartwarming sight. In the ward, Wynn and Mila were playing together. It was a scene that Philip wanted to</p>  <p id = > safeguard. “Daddy.” Seeing Philip, Mila ran over with her arms wide open and threw herself into Philip’s arms. Philip carried her high into the air while Mila giggled with joy. Mila’s voice was crisp like wind chimes. After playing for a while, Wynn pulled Philip into the resting area. Wynn hesitated for a brief moment before she asked, “Philip, tell me honestly, did you do anything to Eric?” Philip knew Wynn would ask him that. He replied, “Of course not. What would I do to him? We just had a chat.” “And then?”</p>  <p id = > Wynn’s expression was full of disbelief. “And then, he went home, of course.” Philip shrugged. Wynn simply could not believe his words. She knew exactly what sort of person Eric was. Would he go home after having only a brief chat with Philip? Philip noticed that Wynn did not believe him, so he explained further, “It’s true, I’m not lying to you. Perhaps he was touched by my words. He cried bitterly, admitted his mistakes, and went home.” Wynn stared at Philip, trying to search for traces of deceit, but he seemed very sincere throughout. Were all men like that now? Able to spout nonsense with their eyes open without blinking at all. “I’ll call him and ask,”</p>  <p id = > Wynn suddenly declared before taking her phone out. Philip was startled before he became flustered. Oh no! He was about to be exposed!</p>   <h2 id =chapter-239 > Chapter 239</h2>  <p id = > With her arms crossed, Wynn raised her chin, looked straight at Philip, and dialed Eric’s number. The fact was, even if Philip really had taught Eric a lesson, Wynn would not say anything. That was because Eric really had gone too far this time. If the Yates pursued the matter, Wynn would</p>  <p id = > definitely take Philip’s side. Beep, beep, beep… A long wait ensued. In the end, the call went unanswered. After a while, Wynn gave up trying and said to Philip dubiously, “Okay, I’ll believe you for once.” Philip grinned, touched her cheek that was still slightly red and swollen, and asked, “Is it still painful?” Wynn shook her head shyly and said, “It has been treated. I’m fine.” The two stared into each other’s eyes. “Damn it, I almost forgot!”</p>  <p id = > Philip slapped his forehead out of the blue and hurried out. “Wynn, I’ll pick you up later.” Wynn was puzzled, totally unaware of what Philip was up to.</p>  <p id = > Oh, right. Philip had asked her the day before if she was free today. That was bad. Wynn had promised to have dinner with her colleagues that night.</p>  <p id = > Nonetheless, after hesitating for a while, Wynn called Derrick and explained why she would not be attending the celebratory dinner that night. Derrick was a reasonable person and simply said that there would be more opportunities in the future. Wynn heaved a breath of relief and stood by the doorway of the ward, staring at the direction Philip had run off in. She looked forward to seeing what Philip was about to do. On Philip’s side, he hurried toward the French restaurant that he had made reservations at the day prior. When the restaurant manager saw Philip, he greeted him respectfully, “Mr. Clarke, you’re here. Where’s Mrs. Clarke?” The chubby manager looked around and was puzzled when he did not see Philip’s female companion. The day before, Mr. Clarke had paid a deposit of thirty thousand to reserve the entire restaurant for the night. At first, the manager refused Philip’s request because the latter was dressed like an average working-class person. The manager only changed his mind when Philip paid the deposit.</p> <p id = > He was part of the hidden second-generation. Philip panted as he asked, “I want to check on the preparations.” The manager was very enthusiastic and personally led Philip around to look at the setup of the venue. Outside the window, the beautiful scenery of Lake Phoenix could be seen. “Mr. Clarke, as per your instructions, we’ve hired a pianist accompanied by a violinist.</p>  <p id = > Additionally, when Mrs. Clarke arrives, rose petals will fall around her. The roses that will rain on her are the ones you wanted, the freshest of roses,</p>  <p id = > imported from Erdogo. Our waiters also hand-picked the petals and soaked them in the fragrance of Chanel…” The manager spoke continuously while Philip followed closely from behind, nodding his head silently. “Okay, well done. This is the final payment of two hundred thousand.” Philip was very happy as he handed his card to the manager. The manager grinned broadly, took the card, and said, “Mr. Clarke, please wait a moment.” After swiping the card, the manager quickly returned and gave the card back to Philip. If the manager had any doubts before, all of them had been dispelled now.</p>  <p id = > Two hundred thousand. Very few people could fork out two hundred thousand for a reservation. Philip Clarke was one. Therefore, the manager assumed that Philip was a low-key nouveau riche. Such customers had to be served well. As Philip left, the waiters of the restaurant watched his disappearing figure. Their faces were full of envy and jealousy. “Wow, that man is so rich that he booked the entire restaurant for two hundred thousand.</p>  <p id = > How nice would it be if I had such a low profile and a rich boyfriend.” “I wonder who that woman is. She’s so fortunate to have someone who loves her that much. I’m so envious.” “Okay, that’s enough. Hurry up with the preparations. We can’t afford to make any mistakes tonight!” The manager admonished sternly when he saw the idiotic expressions on the waiters’</p>  <p id = > faces. Night soon fell. At the Riverdale Public Hospital, one after another, a long line of Mercedes-Benz decorated with flowers pulled over at the main entrance. The scene instantly attracted everyone’s attention.</p>  <h2 id =chapter-240 > Chapter 240</h2>  <p id = > Everyone gathered around the entrance and watched on curiously.</p>  <p id = > Additionally, many people took out their phones and started to record videos to upload onto TikTok and other social media platforms. “Damn! Who is this rich person, spending so much money? So many luxury cars, is the person proposing?” “No idea. This is too glamorous for words. I’m so envious!” “It would be nice if they were here to pick me up. This is too romantic, and the plot is too surreal. It’s exactly like something that would</p>  <p id = > appear in a K-drama.” Many female nurses crowded around the entrance.</p>  <p id = > They were each staring at the scene in envy. At this time, Wynn walked out from behind the crowd with Mila in her arms. She had received a call that asked her to bring Mila to the hospital’s entrance. When Wynn arrived at the door, the four chauffeurs standing next to the Mercedes-Benz vehicles bowed in unison and stretched out their hands in a gentlemanly fashion.</p>  <p id = > “Miss Johnston, please get in the car.” In an instant, everyone’s gaze was locked on Wynn. She was the main star! Envy, jealousy! However, the appearance of the woman was ethereal, and the little girl in her arms was also very adorable and beautiful! Wynn was completely taken aback. She glanced at the long line of luxurious vehicles and got into one of them amid the envious stares of the crowd. Wynn was in a daze. Shortly after, the car pulled over in front of the French restaurant. Wynn got off the car with Mila in her arms. Her dull eyes were full of suspicion. “Mom, are we here for dinner?” Little Mila blinked her large, jewel-like eyes as she asked. Her face had an expression full of amazement. Wynn had no idea how to respond to her question. “Miss Johnston, welcome. Please follow me.” At the door, a waitress approached Wynn with a huge smile on her face, bowed, and made a gesture of invitation. “Oh, sure.” Wynn’s mind was still in a blur as she replied the waitress. When Wynn entered the restaurant and saw the immaculate arrangement, she was both surprised and moved. As the strings of a violin sounded, accompanied by a piano playing in the background, a familiar singing voice filled the restaurant. Wynn held in</p> <p id = > with one hand and covered her mouth with the other. Tears began to stream down her cheeks in big droplets. At that very moment, she was full of bliss. It was Philip. It had to be Philip! He remembered what today was. It was their wedding anniversary! Amid the music, from a dim corner, Philip walked out slowly.</p>  <p id = > He was dressed in a clean and crisp suit and was holding a bouquet of red roses in his hand. His face was wearing a smile. With both knees on the ground, Philip raised his head and looked at Wynn who was still immersed in her emotions, crying and smiling blissfully. Philip said, “Wynnie, I didn’t</p>  <p id = > treat you well enough in the past, and you’ve suffered a lot because of me.</p>  <p id = > Starting from today, you’ll be the happiest woman in the world.” Wynn looked at Philip. Her tearful eyes carried an expression of seriousness. At that moment, all her grievances had disappeared. She cherished the romantic moment a lot. “Dad, I want one too,” Mila said jealously. Wynn and Philip exchanged a glance and smiled. From the huge bouquet, Philip took out a single stalk and gave it to Mila. “Okay, this one is for Mila.” Mila was very happy, and she kissed Philip on the cheek. Subsequently, Philip stood up and looked at Wynn. He turned his head to the side and raised his cheek.</p>  <p id = > Wynn rolled her eyes before planting a quick kiss on his cheek. The waiters standing at the side were wiping their tears at this moving scene. What a warm and happy picture it was. It would be great if the picture belonged to them. However, that picture of happiness came to an abrupt end! All of a sudden! A figure dashed into the restaurant and walked up to Philip and Wynn! Slap! Chloe appeared out of the blue and angrily slapped Wynn. She pointed at Wynn’s nose and cursed, “Sl*t! You’re not worthy!” As she said that, she snatched the bouquet of roses from Wynn’s hands, threw it to the ground, and trampled over it with her high heels. It was all too sudden!</p>  <p id = > Everyone was shocked. Especially the waiters, all of them stared with their eyes wide open and mouths covered. They could not believe that such a thing was actually happening. Among them, someone could be seen recording a video of the scene. A total reversal! “Are you mad!” Philip roared in anger. His eyes were red as he furiously slapped Chloe’s face. The</p> <p id = > woman in front of him was crazy! Chloe clutched her face as she looked resentfully at Philip and Wynn. She said, “Philip Clarke, I won’t let you off.</p>  <p id = > With me around, don’t expect to live in peace for a single day!” Chloe then stared at Wynn and said with a sneer, “Wynn Johnston, you’re so pitiful. Up till this day, you still don’t know who Philip Clarke is. You pathetic clown!”</p>  <p id = > With that being said, Chloe turned around and left. On the other hand, Philip clenched his fists and glared furiously at Chloe’s back before turning his attention to Wynn. Wynn was absolutely livid. She picked Mila up and</p>  <p id = > another slap landed on Philip’s face. “Philip Clarke, I’ve had enough! You must resolve the matter between the both of you. Otherwise, we’ll get a divorce!” Wynn had had enough. She was willing to be hospitalized for Philip. Even if it meant letting Eric humiliate her, she would not wish for Philip to be hurt. However, as a woman, Wynn could not tolerate another woman interfering with their marriage. Furthermore, that woman had a marriage agreement with her husband in the first place. Fuming, Wynn left the restaurant with Mila. Philip stood there alone with an expression full of anger and helplessness. After violently kicking the flowers on the ground, Philip rushed after Wynn. “Wynnie, wait for me. Please listen to what I have to say,” Philip shouted as he chased after Wynn. Wynn stopped, turned around, looked at Philip angrily, and said, “Okay, tell me then, who are you?</p>  <p id = > Why does Chloe keep telling me that I don’t know who you are? Who is Philip Clarke? What have you been hiding from me? Why can’t you tell me?”</p>  <h2 id =chapter-241 > Chapter 241</h2>  <p id = > Philip was taken aback and did not know how to respond. He said, “Wynnie, please believe me. I’ll tell you someday but not now. I have my own problems.” Philip really wanted to tell Wynn, but reality did not allow him to do so. Giada was still in Riverdale, and Philip had not figured out what she had planned yet. That woman would not let Philip off easily, and the people Philip treasured the most were Wynn and Mila. Therefore, he did not have a choice. Wynn scoffed at his words. “Fine, keep your secret then. Mila will be having her surgery tomorrow, so I won’t argue with you today.”</p>  <p id = > With that said, Wynn turned around with tears in her eyes and left with Mila in her arms. Philip’s lonely silhouette stayed as he watched Wynn’s back disappear into the distance. Additionally, he saw Mila who was perched on Wynn’s shoulders trying to reach out her arms to him. ‘Wynn, I’ll tell you someday. ‘That day will arrive very soon. ‘When everything has been resolved, I’ll bring you and Mila back to the Clarke family with fanfare!’</p>  <p id = > On the other side, after Chloe left the restaurant, she returned to her hotel and sat down on the carpet alone. She drunk red wine until she became intoxicated. With eyes full of tears, she stared at the night scenery of the city and mumbled, “Why, why do you treat me this way? What have I done wrong?” To Chloe, Philip was her everything. However, her everything seemed to belong to someone else as of now! She could not accept it! The third young lady of one of the biggest families in the capital city was troubled by the affairs of her own heart. If the public found out about it, it would definitely cause a scandal. A strong woman like her would actually get drunk over a man. The moonlight outside the window spilled into the hotel suite. Chloe stood up and slowly removed her lacy nightgown, revealing her graceful figure. She stared at her naked reflection in the mirror.</p>  <p id = > About one inch away from her heart, there was a hideous scar. It was a stab wound. She could still remember that Philip had once risked his life for her.</p> <p id = > Warm tears flowed down her cheeks and dripped onto her chest. Chloe stroked the scar as she murmured with trembling lips, “Philip, have you forgotten? This here, I gouged it for you before. Why can’t you love me?</p>  <p id = > Why?” If all the emotions in the world could be explained logically, there would not be so much regret. Chloe knew very well what she should do logically, but she could not bring herself to stop. She loved Philip to the point of madness. She was a woman troubled by love, and there was no escape for her. Her only trouble was not being able to obtain Philip’s love.</p>  <p id = > Back at the Yates family compound, Bob Yates could be seen sitting on the Grand Preceptor armchair in the inner hall, playing with the jade thumb ring that Philip had gifted him. Bob Yates was unable to conceal the smile on his lips. It was good stuff. This item was worth one hundred million! That useless Philip had managed to find such a valuable treasure, but the point was, he ignorantly gave it away to Bob. Sure enough, a piece of trash would never be worthy of a treasure. All of a sudden! The butler barged in and shouted in panic, “Old Master, it’s bad!” Bob glared at him angrily and yelled, “What are you shouting for? Such insolence!” The butler</p>  <p id = > immediately bowed his head. His body was trembling all over. “So, what is it?” Bob said coldly, still fiddling with the jade thumb ring. “Old Master, the Young Master, he’s in trouble.” The butler looked very worried and was sweating profusely. Just moments ago he had been notified that Young Master Eric Yates was grievously injured. The latter’s limbs were broken and all his teeth were shattered. Eric Yates was now in the hospital and was in critical condition. It was a catastrophe! Someone had laid hands on the Yates! Smack! Bob stood up furiously, shaking in anger. Thump, thump, thump! With his cane, he rushed out of the hall while saying anxiously,</p>  <p id = > “Hurry, bring me to the hospital, quickly! My Eric, nothing must happen to you!” Bob was very distressed and ordered someone to bring him to the hospital. Eric was his precious grandson, his youngest one at that, and the one he loved the most. In a ward in Second Public Hospital, Eric was lying on a bed. His eyes were blank, and his whole body wrapped in bandages.</p>  <p id = > Ever since he woke up, he only stared at the ceiling blankly. There was no expression on his face. He had three broken ribs, and all his arms and legs</p> <p id = > had been broken. It would take at least one year for him to recover! As he stared at the ceiling, his dull eyes suddenly became bloodshot. His words were muffled as he roared in anger, “I want to kill him! I’m going to kill him!” He was nothing but a vegetable now! The doctors said that he would face difficulties holding a knife and fork in the future, and he would have to undergo a long period of rehabilitation! What more would it take for him to walk. Of course, Philip was not aware of all this. Eric’s other injuries had been caused by Theo’s men. Offending Mr. Clarke was the same as courting death!</p>  <h2 id =chapter-242 > Chapter 242</h2>  <p id = > Next to Eric stood a distinguished, middle-aged man in his mid-forties. His appearance was quite similar to Eric’s. He was the chairman of Seafare Trading and was Eric’s father, Samson Yates. Additionally, on the top of Eric’s hospital bed, there was a middle-aged woman dressed in luxurious</p>  <p id = > clothes. The woman’s eyes had turned red from crying. “Who is so cruel to have beaten my son up like this?” She was Eric’s mother, Cecelia Drew.</p>  <p id = > Her heart was in pain. Evidently, a mother’s children were her most beloved.</p>  <p id = > At that moment, seeing that her child had been hurt by someone else, Cecelia’s heart was bleeding! “Eric, tell me, who hurt you? I’ll ask your father to capture that person!” Cecelia wanted to hold Eric’s hand but was afraid of hurting him, so she could only watch anxiously. A stream of tears fell from the corners of Eric’s eyes. His chapped lips trembled as he said,</p>  <p id = > “Dad, you must avenge me! It’s Philip Clarke, that spineless piece of trash!</p>  <p id = > Kill him for me! I’m a cripple now!” Samson had not said a single word ever since he appeared in the ward. Nevertheless, his face was extremely dark. Philip Clarke? Was he not a useless piece of trash? Why did he do such a thing? Was he tired of living? “Samson, say something! Don’t you feel bad that our son was beaten up by that worthless piece of trash? We must avenge our son! I want that b*stard to pay with his life!” Cecelia was crying, but her eyes were filled with malice! “Enough!” Samson became annoyed with Cecelia and glared at her. “You’re the woman of the house, but you don’t even take care of your son properly. He causes trouble all the time. If he really didn’t do anything in the first place, why did Philip do this to him?” “What did you say? Isn’t he your son too? Fine, Samson Yates, I must be blind to have followed you! My son is suffering…” Cecelia stood up abruptly, pushed Samson aside, and started to make a scene. Seeing his heartbroken wife and at son lying on the hospital bed, Samson felt rather distressed in his heart. Hence, he hugged Cecelia and said, “Okay, fine, stop</p> <p id = > crying already. I’ll deal with this matter. I’ll be sure to make Philip suffer ten times more pain than Eric.” Samson truly did not take that useless Philip seriously. However, why did Philip dare take things so far? Samson knew his son very well. He must have kept something from them. Nevertheless, it did not matter. Philip had to pay for it! With that said, Samson turned around and left the ward. On the other side, Bob arrived at the hospital right after Samson left. When he saw Eric wrapped up in bandages, lying on the</p>  <p id = > hospital bed, he flew into a rage. He hit his cane against the floor and bellowed, “Who did this to my grandson! I want him to pay tenfold!” When Eric saw Bob, he immediately burst into tears and started crying. “Grandpa, I’m a cripple now. It’s Philip, he did this to me. Avenge me!” When Bob heard that Philip was the culprit, he became flushed with anger. The hand holding his cane trembled as he said, “Okay, Eric, I’ll capture Philip right now and break his bones. I’ll avenge you!” Having said that, Bob brought a few men with him and sped aggressively through the night to Martha’s home. More than half an hour later, Philip received a call from Martha.</p>  <p id = > “Mom, it’s so late, what’s the matter? Philip was in his small seventy to eighty square meters house, busy preparing the things to be used after Mila’s surgery the day after. He had also just distributed tens of thousands worth of bonuses to his employees in group chats 940, 901, and 551 as a special reward to them. “Philip Clarke, you’ve got some guts! Come back here right now!” A loud shout was then heard. It was not Martha’s voice on the other end of the line, but Bob Yates. Philip frowned as he immediately realized something. He calmly said, “Bob Yates, are you here for Eric?” “Very well, Philip Clarke, you dare call me by my full name? You’re really insolent.</p>  <p id = > Get the hell back here at once!” Bob was absolutely livid. After saying that, he slammed the phone. At the Old Johnston Manor, Martha and Charles stood in one corner as they trembled together. They had no idea why the old man had turned up at their house in the middle of the night with so many men in tow. He looked exceptionally furious. Martha exchanged a glance with Charles as she cursed internally, ‘D*mn Philip, he must have caused trouble again! This time, he even provoked the old man! Even if he doesn’t die this time, he won’t leave unscathed.’ Bob merely held the tiger head on</p> <p id = > his cane and sat stoically on the sofa with a grim expression on his face. The entire room was permeated with a murderous aura. Shortly after, Wynn returned home. She had also received a call from her mother. As soon as she walked in, she saw her grandfather sitting on the sofa somberly “Grandpa, why are you here?” Wynn asked politely. But! Smack! Bob raised his cane</p>  <p id = > and struck Wynn’s leg! Wynn knelt on the ground in pain. Her face turned pale and big drops of sweat began to pour from her forehead. “Grandpa?”</p>  <p id = > She did not understand why her grandfather was in such a mood. It was his first time beating her like that. “Kneel! Kneel until Philip comes back!” Bob shouted angrily, “Useless piece of trash! You took a wolf into the house!</p>  <p id = > You’re a disgrace!”</p>  <h2 id =chapter-243 > Chapter 243</h2>  <p id = > The house was filled with a murderous aura. No one spoke. Martha, who had always been unreasonably noisy, was now quietly standing at one corner like an obedient baby. She was looking with lowered eyelids at the kneeling Wynn, afraid to make one sound. Wynn knelt with poise and said stubbornly, “Grandpa, can you at least tell me what’s going on? Did Philip do something wrong?” “Tell Philip to get back here at once!” Bob bellowed angrily. His face had a stony expression, and a biting chill could be seen in his eyes. Martha dared not say anything and merely stood there as she looked at Wynn. She winked at Wynn as a signal for her to call Philip. That wastrel must have caused trouble, otherwise, the old man would not have rushed to their house in the middle of the night. He had also brought many men with him, all of whom were lined up outside. There were also four more men inside the house with them. Scary! Martha’s hatred toward Philip increased just like that. Wynn had just returned and had not figured out what the cause of all of it was yet. Nevertheless, she had a vague feeling that it had something to do with Eric. Although Wynn appeared stubborn on the surface, she was actually very nervous. They were about to face her grandfather, Bob Yates. Ever since she was young, she had felt that he was a formidable person. The daunting aura that he carried was fully portrayed at the moment as Wynn felt immense pressure from him. “Grandpa, you must tell me what Philip did, otherwise, I can’t call for him,” Wynn said weakly, but her kneeling posture was still firm. Bob glared at Wynn and felt sorry for her from the bottom of his heart. Such a fine young lady had chosen</p>  <p id = > to marry a wimp and become the bout of everyone’s jokes. In the past, Bob purposely did not attend Wynn’s wedding and even announced that the Yates would not acknowledge Wynn as their granddaughter. That caused Wynn to lose her job in Fortune 500, and she ended up in Beacon Pharmaceutical as a result. “Wynn, you’re not involved in this matter. You just need to call Philip to come back. The rest of it has nothing to do with you!” Bob said sternly in a tone full of deterrence. Wynn was upset when she heard those words. As Philip’s wife, it was her right to share his burdens.</p> <p id = > “Philip will not return tonight. He’s in the hospital with Mila. You can talk to me instead. If he made a mistake, I’ll kowtow to you and beg for your forgiveness,” Wynn persisted. However. Bob then stood up with a sneer on his face and approached Wynn with his cane. The scene that ensued next shocked everyone! Without another word, Bob raised his hand and slapped Wynn across the face. The loud smack was heard throughout the entire hall.</p>  <p id = > “What right do you have to speak to me like that? Can you represent Philip?</p>  <p id = > Do you know what he has done?” Bob’s face was flushed as he roared, “If Philip doesn’t return tonight, you’ll continue to kneel! When he returns, that’s when you can stand up!” When would this foolish granddaughter of his come back to her senses? Although Bob was furious, he still cared for Wynn. Martha dared not say anything even though Wynn had been beaten.</p>  <p id = > She was merely a spineless, two-faced person, who could only act arrogantly in front of people like Philip. When faced with someone like her father, she dared not make any waves. Despite that, she was still distressed at the sight of Wynn being beaten, and said anxiously, “Wynnie, hurry up and tell that wretch to return at once! Why are you still protecting him now?</p>  <p id = > He should be responsible for his own mistakes. He’s not the son-in-law of Johnston family, nor the grandson-in-law of the Yates family.” While she cursed, Martha tried to discern Bob’s mood. Nevertheless, the stubborn Wynn only continued to kneel without saying a word or taking out her phone. Bob nearly exploded in fury! He lamented her bullheadedness, pointed at her viciously, and said through gritted teeth, “Very well, you’ve chosen to rebel! From now on, you’ll no longer be the granddaughter of Bob Yates. The Yates family will not acknowledge your bloodline!” Those words were very harsh.</p>   <h2 id =chapter-244 > Chapter 244</h2>  <p id = > Martha became startled at those words and rushed at her father while shouting, “Dad, you can’t do this! Wynn is your granddaughter! This matter is that wimp’s fault!” She turned to Wynn angrily, held her shoulders, and shook them desperately. “Wynnie, don’t be silly. Just hurry up and tell that wimp to come back. We won’t get involved in this matter. He must solve his own problems.” Why was her daughter so stupid? Was it worth it to stand against Old Master Yates for that wastrel? However. Wynn laughed coldly as her eyes became tearful. She glanced at Martha before looking at Bob. “Grandpa, I know you’re here for Eric. I don’t know what happened to him, but you laid your hands on me as soon as I stepped in here. Did you find out about what Eric did? Do you know what Eric did to me today?”</p>  <p id = > Wynn was infuriated. This was her grandfather, an old man who did not care about right or wrong and distinguished between grandson and granddaughter. To Bob, Eric was the flesh and blood of the Yates, his precious grandson. Was Wynn not his granddaughter? Bob’s mouth twitched. However, his love for his grandson caused him to ignore her statement as he retorted, “Eric is the grandson of the Yates family. Even if he did something wrong, it should be the Yates who punish him. An outsider has no right to break his limbs!” Thump, thump, thump! As he spoke, Bob angrily tapped his black-and-gold cane that was embellished with a tiger’s head against the floor that was tiled. Everyone in the house fell silent. What?</p>  <p id = > Philip broke Eric’s limbs? Martha was the first person who fell into disbelief. Her breathing became rapid, and her eyes rolled back into her head as she almost passed out. They were doomed! Philip had wreaked huge havoc this time! Wynn was obviously startled by this as well. She had not expected such an outcome at all. Despite that, she did not have any regrets.</p>  <p id = > Philip was her husband, and she was willing to stand by his side. “He asked for it.” To everyone’s astonishment, Wynn bit her lip and said this. “Very well, very well indeed!” Bob laughed menacingly and ordered his men,</p> <p id = > “Beat her! I want to see how hard the bones of Wynn Johnston are! Let’s see if Philip can return before you’ve been killed!” Two bodyguards stepped forward and swung their big hands. Consequently, several blows landed on Wynn’s face! Wynn was a feisty woman. Although she was beaten up and ended up vomiting blood from her mouth, she knelt steadfastly without crying out in pain. Bob stared at Wynn frostily. He refused to believe that Philip would not return! “Call Philip! Tell him that Wynn is here. If he doesn’t come back, I’ll beat her to death!” Bob turned around and shouted at Martha. Martha got a fright. She picked up the phone. Her fingers shook as she dialed Philip’s number. “Phil… Philip, come back at once! Wynn, Wynnie is being beaten to death…” Cries echoed throughout the house. It was Martha’s wails. She was heartbroken at the sight of her little girl being beaten. When Philip received the call, he had just arrived at the street right</p>  <p id = > outside the Old Johnston Manor. He heard the slapping sounds from the receiver and was immediately enraged. D*mn Bob Yates! He was courting death! The entire Yates family was courting their death! Very well! He had given them an inch, and they had now taken a mile! The entire Yates family would disappear from the world then! Philip dashed into the manor, and as soon as he stepped into the house, he saw Wynn kneeling in front of Bob.</p>  <p id = > Wynn’s face was red and swollen. Not to mention, her mouth was full of blood, and the two bodyguards showed no signs of stopping as they slapped her face back and forth. “You’re dead!” An angry roar! Philip pounced and threw a couple of punches. Bam! Before the two bodyguards could realize what was happening, they each received a punch to the face and immediately slumped back in a daze. Despite that, they were physically strong after all and could take Philip’s blows. With a grim expression on his face, Philip squatted and inhaled coldly. Especially when he saw the injuries on Wynn’s face. He could hardly contain his anger! They dared hit Wynn!</p>  <p id = > It was tantamount to playing with fire! “Philip Clarke, you’re finally home.</p>  <p id = > Are you going to come with me quietly, or do I need to drag you with me?”</p>  <p id = > Bob knocked his cane on the tiles of the floor once again, producing a loud, frightening thump. Philip turned his face around. His eyes could be seen</p> <p id = > exuding a bitter chill, and his mouth was upturned at its corners. He was wearing a very dangerous smile! If Chloe were there, she would have definitely understood the meaning of his smile! Philip was infuriated! His wrath would flatten mountains and destroy rivers! Philip Clarke of the past, he was wearing the very same smile he had on when he annihilated the rivals of Chloe and the Sommerset family! “Bob Yates, do you know the taste of total family destruction?” Philip asked.</p>   <h2 id =chapter-245 > Chapter 245</h2>  <p id = > Bob scoffed nonchalantly. “Philip, you’re just a worthless piece of trash.</p>  <p id = > Can you even brag about something like that?” Philip clenched his fists tightly, his dark eyes scrutinizing the four bodyguards in the house along with the men surrounding the area. It would not be easy. Although he had learned a few moves from Reed, his two fists would be insufficient for so many people. He had to wrap things up quickly. “Bob Yates, I think the number of people you brought won’t suffice,” Philip jeered. The sneer on Bob’s face remained. Although he did not know where Philip had gotten the courage to say such things to him, he had brought many people just to capture him. How could the tables turn? Could a useless wimp like him create a miracle? At this time, Martha stepped forward, pointed at Philip’s nose, and shouted, “Philip, you’re to be held responsible for your own mess!</p>  <p id = > The Johnston family has nothing to do with this!” Martha was scared and eager to cut off all ties with Philip. The old man was angry, and the</p>  <p id = > consequences were unimaginable. However, what Martha did not expect was for the repercussions to become even more serious when he was angry!</p>  <p id = > More serious than the entire sky falling! “Philip, be a man and take responsibility for your own actions. You can break your own arms first and then come with me to kneel in front of Eric to beg for his forgiveness. If he’s willing to let you off, then I’ll let you go. However, you won’t show yourself in Riverdale ever again, and you will divorce Wynn too.” Bob snickered coldly. In his eyes, Philip was nothing more than a useless wimp.</p>  <p id = > Wynn’s heart trembled violently at Bob’s words. Grandpa was very domineering. He was prepared to deny Philip any chance of survival. Would someone like Eric let Philip off the hook so easily? “No, I don’t agree! What right do you have to take Philip away? You didn’t even ask about what Eric did. He deserved it!” Wynn got up and stood in front of Philip, glaring at Bob as she spoke. “Shut up! Another word from you and</p> <p id = > I’ll take care of you too!” Bob was furious. Wynn was constantly testing his limits, and he was very annoyed by that. Even if she was his granddaughter, Bob did not mind teaching her a small lesson if she persisted. Martha was terribly scared.</p>  <p id = > Upon hearing her father’s words, she became even more flustered. She did not wish for her daughter to be hampered by a rotten person like Philip.</p>  <p id = > “Philip Clarke, I don’t care what you’re thinking. From now on, you’re no longer the son-in-law of the Johnston family. My daughter will divorce you!” Martha shouted at Philip desperately. “Shut up!” Philip said angrily as he stared at Martha with daggers in his eyes. He was fed up with Martha’s unprovoked accusations. He had tolerated such a mother-in-law for three years. Martha was caught by surprise, especially when she came into contact with Philip’s murderous gaze. Hence, with her heart pounding rapidly, she said weakly, “Very well, Philip, you dare shout at me now! I don’t have a son-in-law like you! Dad, take this trash away now!” After scolding Philip, Martha took a few steps backward in fear that Philip would rush at her and beat her. She had witnessed it earlier. When Philip came in, he beat up the two bodyguards. The fellow could actually dole out some punches. Bob</p>  <p id = > sneered at Philip with pity in his eyes. “Did you hear that? You’re a single man now. Kneel obediently and break your arms, then come with me to beg for Eric’s forgiveness. Maybe then you can keep your pathetic life.”</p>  <p id = > However. Philip’s expression sank. He raised his eyebrows and asked with a faint smile, “Are you sure you want me to kneel in front of you?” Bob frowned as he felt a sudden surge of dreadfulness and retorted, “Why, do you think you can escape with just two hands? Even if you do manage to, what about your wife and child?” A chill spread across Philip’s eyes. Bob dared to threaten him with Wynn and Mila? In an instant, Philip took the initiative and stepped forward. It has to be said that the bodyguard beside Bob did not even see when Philip made the first move. Bam! One punch!</p>  <p id = > Philip’s punch hit Bob’s face and blood was spilled immediately! Bob staggered backward and slumped limply on the sofa. Blood from his nose was now splattered all over his face as his head buzzed! At his age, he</p> <p id = > could no longer withstand such a blow. He was already dizzy from one strike! The result of Philip’s blow took Martha and the rest of the people in the house by surprise.</p>  <h2 id =chapter-246 > Chapter 246</h2>  <p id = > “Philip, what have you done?!” Martha shrieked. By now, Philip had already eliminated another four bodyguards. Wynn stared at Philip in a daze, realizing once again that he had terrifying fighting skills! The men outside wanted to rush in. However, when they saw Philip standing next to Bob, choking the latter’s neck, they dared not risk it. Bob’s face was bloody, and his breathing was rapid. His hands were trembling as he gave Philip a vicious side-glare and said, “You… you dare lay hands on me! I’ll… I’ll kill you!” Up until now, Bob was still unaware of his situation. Martha was huddled in a corner. She could only watch helplessly as Philip choked her father’s neck. She yelled agitatedly, “Philip, let go at once! If anything happens to my father, I won’t let you off!” How dare the good-for-nothing do this? Nevertheless, Philip only threw a glance at Martha and said,</p>  <p id = > “Martha Yates, he’s your father, not mine. He dared to hit Wynn, he has to pay the price!” With one sentence, Philip made everyone feel as though they had plunged into an icy abyss. Martha never thought that Philip, who had always been useless, would portray such an imposing demeanor. It was the head of the Yates family. Wynn took some time to come back to her senses.</p>  <p id = > She quickly said, “Philip, let him go. He’s my grandfather!” That was right; he was her grandfather after all. Wynn could not bear to watch Philip choke him like that. Philip raised his eyebrows, looked at Wynn, and asked her in all seriousness, “Wynnie, he ordered his men to beat you up indiscriminately and even threatened you and Mila. Are you sure you want me to let him go?” Wynn was now in a dilemma. After a long while, she finally said,</p>  <p id = > “He’s my grandfather after all. Even if he has done something terribly wrong, I must forgive him.” Philip fell silent, and without another word, he slowly loosened his chokehold. Bob’s entire face was flushed red. When Philip let go of him, he opened his mouth and drew big gulps of air. At that moment, Bob truly felt the threat of death. For many years, he had not</p> <p id = > suffered the taste of defeat. However, that day, he had almost died in the hands of Philip, the wastrel. “Wynn, take Mom and Dad out. I want to have a good chat with Old Master Yates.” Philip said solemnly; his eyes had traces of deterrence within them. “Okay.” Wynn did not know what to do, but she could only trust Philip for now. Hopefully, he would not cause any more trouble. Since the old man was in the house and Philip was in a strategic position, the men outside dared not make any rash moves. Philip said sternly, “Old Master, tell your men to withdraw from the house. Believe me, I have the strength to deal with you before they can take any action.”</p>  <p id = > Bob’s head was still buzzing. Hence, after brief consideration, he waved his hand angrily and motioned to his men to withdraw. On the other hand, Wynn pulled Charles and Martha along with her. “Philip, don’t cause any trouble.</p>  <p id = > Just speak to grandpa nicely,” Wynn said to Philip before leaving. She was afraid that Philip might lose his temper and do something irrational. “Okay, I promise.” Philip chuckled. Very soon, only Philip and Bob were left.</p>  <p id = > Sitting on the single-person sofa, Philip said without beating around the bush, “Old Master, what do you think is the current social standing of the Yates family in Riverdale?” Bob was already quite sober at this point.</p>  <p id = > Hearing Philip’s question, he could not help but chuckle. “Philip, even if the Yates are not considered first-class in Riverdale, we’re at least second or third class. Why, is a good-for-nothing like you planning to do something to the Yates?” Bob felt the utmost disdain from Philip’s attitude and mannerisms. What did he mean by that? He wanted to lay his hands on the Yates? A wimp like him? Philip merely smiled indifferently, took out his phone, dialed a number, and said to Bob, “Then, do you want to witness the Yates family’s collapse in ten minutes?” Ba-thump! Bob’s heart sank. He suddenly felt a sense of crisis as he looked at Philip’s nonchalant smile. He felt extremely unsettled. What was happening? How could he feel such pressure from a wastrel? Impossible! After a moment of silence, Bob said slowly, “Philip, I came here out of a fit today. Maybe Eric really did something wrong. Let me go home and have a good talk with him. Why</p> <p id = > don’t we just leave it as it is today?” Bob backed down. Indeed, he felt unprecedented pressure from Philip. That pressure made him think twice.</p>  <p id = > However, Philip ignored his words and merely smiled faintly. “A son’s wrongdoings must be corrected by his father. The Yates family has never produced a good man. I already taught Eric a lesson for what he did today.</p>  <p id = > Nonetheless, Old Master, why are you so eager to stand up for him? Is the entire Yates family less than one Eric?” With that said, when the call connected the next second, Philip calmly said in front of Bob, “Old Man George, in ten minutes, I want all of Yates’ properties to go bankrupt. That applies to any amount of profit that the Yates have gained through illegal means. Additionally, related evidence of their dirty dealings should be handed over to the Law Enforcement Bureau!”</p>  <h2 id =chapter-247 > Chapter 247</h2>  <p id = > Bob sneered reflexively when he heard Philip’s words. Was he joking? Ten minutes and the Yates family will go bankrupt? “Philip, do you know the value of the assets the Yates have? Two billion!” Bob laughed coldly, his eyes full of contempt for Philip. “Do you really think you can make the Yates family go bankrupt with just one phone call? You’re too naïve.” Bob shook his head and suddenly felt that all his worries had been for nothing.</p>  <p id = > Philip was just a little good at fighting. How could he really have the means to make someone go bankrupt just like that? Was he becoming senile? He was actually scared by that wretch. However. Philip smiled placidly and said, “Since you don’t believe me, let’s do it this way. We’ll start with Samson Yates. He’s Eric’s father, so he has failed in his responsibilities as a father to teach Eric well.” After saying that, Philip called George Thomas again. “The plan has changed. I want the Yates’’ properties to go bankrupt one by one, starting with Samson Yates’.” On the other end of the line, George replied respectfully, “Yes, Young Master, please wait for a moment while I handle it.” After the call disconnected, the room fell silent again.</p>  <p id = > Bob could not understand why Philip spoke with such confidence. Well, he would wait and see. At this time, Samson was in his office. He had gotten in touch with a few top-notched hooligans in Riverdale. He wanted to teach Philip a lesson that he would never forget for the rest of his life. “Remember, I want him crippled, not dead,” Samson said ominously. They each took Samson’s money one by one and said with a smile, “Don’t worry, Mr. Yates.</p>  <p id = > We’ve worked together for many years. We won’t disappoint you.” Samson nodded, his eyelids jumping madly. All of a sudden, a flustered female secretary barged in and shouted, “Mr. Yates, something has happened! Our traders overseas have suddenly cut off all supply. Eight domestic branch companies have also received notifications from their suppliers that all supplies will be halted. Furthermore, they have received notices from the tax department saying that there is a problem with our taxation. The</p> <p id = > company is now suspended, and all financial and accounting books have retained by the tax department!” The female secretary was rather agitated.</p>  <p id = > All of a sudden, the company was facing so many major incidents! Each one was enough to make Seafare Trading go bankrupt! Samson flinched.</p>  <p id = > “What? Say it clearly, why was the supply cut off without any prior warning? Hasn’t our finance team been doing a good job all this while? Why are we under investigation all of a sudden?” Samson started to panic. Which company had no financial problems? If they were exposed, Samson would be put in jail for at least ten years! “Boss, we don’t know either. We heard that it was an anonymous report,” the female secretary replied nervously.</p>  <p id = > An anonymous report? Samson stood up. Big drops of sweat were dripping from his forehead as he slammed the table. “It should be okay. Our books are very detailed and there shouldn’t be any problems. Now, the problem is with the foreign and domestic suppliers. Why did they cut off the supply?”</p>  <p id = > What a joke. The Seafare Trading Company was a trading company, and a foreign one at that! With their suppliers no longer willing to send them supplies, Samson would have to fork out a huge sum of money to find new suppliers. It was a matter of both time and money. The female secretary hesitated for a long while before saying, “They said they found a new trading partner that offered to pay half our price.” “What? Half? Isn’t that equivalent to no profit at all?” Samson was shocked. At half the price, there was no profit to be made at all. Therefore, he was very sure that it was a competitor! At this moment, Samson was in a state of confusion as he hurriedly said, “Hurry up and find out who contacted those suppliers. I must find out! I want to see who dares mess around with Samson Yates!” The secretary left, and only Samson and the few hooligans remained in the huge conference room. Nevertheless, the hooligans knew that Samson was facing a business crisis now, so they left quickly as well. Right then, before Samson could take a breather, the female secretary from before ran into the room once again. Her expression this time was highly unsettled. “What now?</p> <p id = > Speak slowly!” Samson could tell that something else had happened. “Boss, our downstream channel distributors are requesting returns and refunds!”</p>  <p id = > The secretary gulped. “All? Returns and refunds?” Samson was</p>  <p id = > flabbergasted, and his breathing became rapid. Additionally, his face turned red! If all the goods were returned, and the money was refunded, Seafare Trading would go bankrupt! Assets worth a total of one billion! Ruined just like that? “Get someone to suppress it! A return and refund cannot happen!”</p>  <p id = > Samson said menacingly. The secretary said as she cried, “We can’t do that, Boss. They have already blocked the doors of all the branches and are demanding we do so. There are problems with our goods, all of which are fakes. The Bureau of Industry and Commerce is already investigating the matter.” Crack! Samson’s heart shattered into pieces. “Fakes? How could that be?” Samson was in a complete panic now. If the issue was investigated, not only would he go bankrupt, but he would end up in jail! The secretary cried. “I don’t know. The people from the Tax Department and the Bureau of Industry and Commerce are downstairs. They want to see you. The security stopped them at the door.” Samson collapsed in his chair. He could only stare at the chandelier on the ceiling with his dull eyes. They had come so soon. He did not even know where the fakes had come from.</p>  <h2 id =chapter-248 > Chapter 248</h2>  <p id = > His opponent was too formidable! He or she was driving him to his grave! Samson could not understand how he had provoked such an opponent.</p>  <p id = > Nevertheless, he did not have the time to think about it. Samson quickly took out his phone and called his father. At the moment, only his father could save him. Very soon, Bob, who was still in the Old Johnston Manor, received a call from Samson. Bob’s ringtone was like an evil melody. Bob stared at his phone on the table for a long time, afraid to answer it. It had been less than ten minutes since Philip declared that he would make the Seafare Trading Company that belonged to Samson go bankrupt. Could it be… Impossible! “Old Master, you should pick up the call. Samson must be calling you for help,” Philip said as he sipped his tea calmly. Bob was dubious but answered the call anyway. Almost immediately, Samson’s crying voice was from the other end of the phone, “Dad, you must save me</p>  <p id = > this time. My company has gone bankrupt. The business and tax authorities are also after me!” Ba-thump! Bob’s heart took a dive, and he gaped at Philip who was indifferent. He really had done what he said he would do.</p>  <p id = > “Samson, what did you say?” Bob was still in disbelief as he asked in a quivering voice. “Dad, the company… the company is bankrupt! They’re here for me, they want to take me away. Think of something quickly!”</p>  <p id = > Samson was anxious and terrified. Once he was caught, he would be put in jail for sure! At this moment, Bob finally flew into a panic. His eyes fell on Philip, and he asked, “Did you really do this?” Philip nodded and said,</p>  <p id = > “That’s right, and it’s only the appetizer.” That one sentence from Philip broke Bob’s final defense. Samson naturally heard the exchange of words from the other end of the line and asked in nervous curiosity, “Dad, who are you talking to? Who did what?” Bob said quaveringly, “Samson, your company’s bankruptcy was caused by Philip.” Although Bob was unwilling to believe it, the truth was right in front of him, and he had no choice but to</p> <p id = > believe it. Philip Clarke actually did it! Who the hell was he? Just one phone call, and in less than ten minutes, Samson’s company went bankrupt!</p>  <p id = > Horrifying! It was simply too horrifying! Was this the useless son-in-law of the Johnston family? When Samson heard this, he was stunned. It took a long while for him to react. “Dad, how could that be? Isn’t he just a useless piece of trash?” Samson could not believe it. He had just been discussing with hooligans how to mutilate Philip. Now, his company was suddenly bankrupt, and the cause of it was Philip? Bob sighed. “He’s right next to me now.” Subsequently, Bob handed the phone to Philip. Philip took the phone from Bob and said with a laugh, “Samson Yates, you have a good son. This is just your appetizer.” Samson thought for a moment before replying,</p>  <p id = > “Philip, I don’t know what Eric did wrong, but since you’ve already maimed him, how about the matter stop here? On the account that you’re the grandson-in-law of the Yates, let’s just stop here.” Samson had no other choice. The wimp that he had always looked down upon had suddenly dealt him a fatal blow. What else could he do? Resist? The representatives of the</p>  <p id = > two different bureaus were waiting for him downstairs. Contrary to his expectations, Philip said, “There are some things that once have been done, cannot be undone. Enjoy your last few days of freedom.” Philip hung up the phone once he was done speaking and said to Bob, “Old Master, I know you’re well connected. You can start setting up your defenses now. I hope you don’t disappoint me.” Bob was taken aback, and his heart began to pound wildly. However, all of a sudden, his gaze became resolute as he asked, “Philip Clarke, are you sure you won’t let go of the Yates?” “If the Yates aren’t destroyed, I’ll have trouble sleeping and eating. Besides, this is the price you have to pay,” Philip replied mildly. Bob was crestfallen.</p>  <p id = > However, he had gone through countless battles over the years and had experienced strong winds and waves. He soon stabilized his mind. “Philip, I have to admit that I’ve underestimated you. Nonetheless, I advise you not to be too heavy-handed, to forgive and forget! The Yates family is not a force to be reckoned with. Before you do anything to the Yates, you should weigh the price of it yourself!” Bob had thought about it thoroughly. At most, Philip only had a few connections. Hence, such action against Samson had most likely exhausted his strength and network. Bob had also thought of the</p> <p id = > possibility that it was all a bluff. The bankruptcy of the Seafare Trading Company was most probably the most Philip could do. Therefore, Bob was quite confident. In Riverdale, apart from the few big families, no one else was qualified to oppose the Yates! Bob was as steady as a mountain when he dialed a number and said, “Old Fargo, I’m facing a bit of difficulty here and need your help.”</p>  <h2 id =chapter-249 > Chapter 249</h2>  <p id = > A loud, booming voice was heard from the other end of the line, containing a trace of melancholiness. “Bob, what has happened for you to call me this late at night? This is very unlike you.” Desmond Fargo was currently at home in his study room, looking at the following day’s work minutes. He was wearing reading glasses, and his hair was white at his temples. He</p>  <p id = > carried the aura of someone who had been in an official position for a long time. His actions and demeanor were both stoic and resolute. Bob Yates was a good friend of his for many years. In the past, both of them were often seen hand-in-hand, achieving numerous accomplishments in the system together. Even though Bob had retired early, he still had a strong influence.</p>  <p id = > That was especially true when it came to many students. Bob flicked a glance at the nonchalant Philip and said, “Desmond, my son Samson is facing some problems in his company. The tax officers got to him and said there are problems with his books. Please help me suppress them. Also, please talk to Jeffrey for me. The Industry and Commerce Bureau said that the goods that were sold by Samson’s company, the Seafare Trading were fakes. Please do me a favor and talk to these two departments. You’re more familiar with them.” Although Bob was getting on in years, he was still very articulate; his words were very concise. He knew very well that if he wanted to save Samson, he had to step forward and contact his old friends. Most importantly, Desmond was still in the system, and his words carried a certain amount of weight. “Problems in Samson’s company? Hasn’t it been doing well all this while? Why so sudden?” Desmond sat up straight and took off his reading glasses. His expression was full of astonishment. It was impossible to say that he had not benefited from Samson over the years. As a junior, respecting one’s elders was beyond reproach. However, many times, the sum involved was huge. Therefore, Desmond was well aware that if Samson got into trouble, he would not be able to escape scotfree either.</p>  <p id = > “Samson’s son, Eric, has offended some people. Consequently, the other party is attacking Samson’s company. Okay, you don’t have to worry about anything else. Just help me deal with the two parties I mentioned just now.”</p> <p id = > Bob was beginning to become anxious. He still had to contact other people.</p>  <p id = > “Very well, Bob. I’ll handle it right away, just wait for my… wait! Who are you people? Who allowed you to barge in here! Get out!” All of a sudden, a shout was heard from the other end of the line. Soon after, Bob heard a voice over the phone say, “Desmond Fargo, you are suspected of having</p>  <p id = > received monetary benefits and being involved in power-for-money deals.</p>  <p id = > You are now under arrest. Please come with us!” Hearing this, Bob trembled reflexively. He shouted apprehensively, “Desmond, Desmond, what happened? Who barged into your house?” With a click, the phone was picked up, and the voice of a middle-aged man that had a trace of amusement within it was heard, “Bob Yates, I’m sorry to inform you that this connection of yours has been severed by us. Desmond Fargo has now been officially apprehended. You should prepare a backup plan now.” Click! Bob fell into a panic. After recovering, he hurriedly dialed Peter’s number. “Hello, Peter, did something happen? Desmond has been arrested.” “Dad, something has happened! I’ve been removed from my post. Now, representatives from the two bureaus are waiting for me by the door. You must save me!” Peter’s cry for help was heard over the phone. Bob became drenched in cold sweat when he heard this! Desmond Fargo had kept a low profile for many years and was responsible for facilitating the Yates family’s actions. That was especially true for the deals they were to make in the future. Bob had also sent Peter into the system for the same purpose. However, Peter had now been arrested as well! Bob had planned for it all his life, yet his two lines had been severed just like that! The two were the Yates family’s future support! Samson’s company had gone bankrupt, Peter had been apprehended, and even Desmond had been arrested as well! Bob was drenched in cold sweat as his hands trembled uncontrollably. At this moment, he finally understood what Philip meant by the taste of total family destruction. “Did you do all that?” Bob endured the tremors in his heart as he asked nervously. Philip sat on the sofa nonchalantly, glanced at his phone, and said, “Next up is Ted Yates.” Ted?! Bob was taken aback for a moment. Nevertheless, he then hurriedly called his favorite grandson to warn him to be careful. However, before he could dial Ted’s number, his phone rang! It was from Ted! At that instant, Bob dared not pick up the call.</p> <p id = > His face paled, and he was afraid that the call would bring bad news. “Pick up the call. Some things are set in stone. Whether you find out sooner or</p>  <p id = > later, the outcome will be the same,” Philip said calmly. With trembling hands, Bob answered the call. Immediately, Ted’s agitated voice was heard over the phone, “Grandpa, there’s trouble! There’s a problem with the oasis development project that’s happening south of Riverdale. The contract went wrong and the entire project is now void. We have to compensate the other party six hundred million due to a breach in the contract!” Six hundred million! Bob’s breathing stuttered all of a sudden. The Yates family had a total of one billion in property and another one billion in terms of investments. They had a total of two billion in assets! When Samson’s company went bankrupt, they suffered a loss of one billion! However, would he dare refuse to pay six hundred million in terms of compensation?</p>  <p id = > The oasis development project that was south of Riverdale was an Apex Group project. He could not afford to abandon it! “Compensate them! We must handle our relationship with the Apex Group properly and try our best to get the project back. We still have a chance to make a comeback!” Bob said through gritted teeth. There was a menacing look on his face. Yes, they still had a chance! As long as the project existed, the Yates would not collapse! The worst thing that could happen was that the Yates would not make much money out of it. However, once their reputation was firmly established, there would be more opportunities for them in the future!</p>  <p id = > Nevertheless, in the next second, Ted exclaimed, “Grandpa, we can’t! The chairman of the Apex Group, George Thomas, has called me personally.</p>  <p id = > The project will no longer be handled by the Yates! Now, not only do we have to compensate them with six hundred million, but the two hundred million that we paid in advance has gone down the drain too!” Bob crumbled at the news. He fell into a slump on the sofa as he clutched his chest and gulped for air. How did such a thing happen? Samson’s company had gone bankrupt! Ted had been taken away! The oasis development project that was south of Riverdale had been terminated with a loss of eight hundred million!</p> <p id = > What the hell had happened exactly? Had the world gone mad? Even if Bob Yates had the greatest of abilities, he could not cause such destruction to the</p>  <p id = > Yates family in a matter of minutes! Bob regretted it now. He bitterly, utterly, absolutely regretted it now! Only then did he realize how stupid he had been to provoke someone like Philip Clarke. He was not a wimp; he was the Devil himself!</p>  <h2 id =chapter-250 > Chapter 250</h2>  <p id = > Bob quickly regained his senses and picked up his phone. He had another way out; the angel investor! As long as the angel investor continued to invest in the Yates, there was still a chance for him to make a comeback! Mr.</p>  <p id = > Clarke. That was right, Mr. Clarke! That angel investor had mentioned it before that his actions were on the account of Mr. Clarke. Bob could not wait to find this mysterious and wealthy Mr. Clarke. However, at this moment. Philip glanced at his phone placidly and asked with a grin, “Old Master, are you trying to approach the foreign businessman that invested one billion in your family last time to come and save you?” Bob was startled.</p>  <p id = > His gaze swept across Philip and saw a trace of victory in the latter’s eyes.</p>  <p id = > Could it be, that Mr. Clarke was… No, impossible! Bob shook his head repeatedly and screamed in utter aversion, “It can’t be you! Impossible!</p>  <p id = > You’re nothing but a worthless piece of trash, the useless son-in-law of the Johnston family!” He would not believe it! However, the next second, Philip dialed a number on his phone and said, “Buffer, retract that investment of one billion.” “Sure, my most esteemed Mr. Clarke. I’ll do it right away,”</p>  <p id = > Buffer’s respectful voice was heard from the other end of the line. He was in the capital city at the moment and had booked a flight to Riverdale for</p>  <p id = > the next day. As soon as Philip’s voice fell, Bob’s phone rang. Bob quickly picked up the phone in hope of a piece of good news. However, another desperate voice was heard from the other end of the line instead, “Old…</p>  <p id = > Old Master, our family has gone bankrupt! The investment of one billion is now gone!” Ka-thunk! Bob could no longer take the pressure. His body went limp, and he sank into the sofa as he stared at the chandelier blankly.</p> <p id = > He was finished. The Yates were finished. In under twenty minutes, the prestigious Yates family had fallen from heaven to hell. At this moment, Bob was paralyzed on the sofa as if he had been drained of blood. Philip stood up, looked at Bob who was crying on the sofa, and said, “This is the Yates family’s comeuppance. You must reap the bitter fruit that you sowed yourself.” With that said, Philip was ready to turn around and leave.</p>  <p id = > However, at this time, Philip’s phone rang. When Philip looked at the display of his phone, he frowned! He turned around. Bob knelt on the ground with his phone in his hand. He had aged considerably for some reason. “Philip, I beg of you, please give the Yates a way out!” Bam, bam, bam! Bob Yate was already so old. Nevertheless, at that moment, he knelt in front of Philip and kowtowed to him as he begged for mercy! The once-uppity Bob Yates now looked like a frail, old man, kneeling and begging for forgiveness. Philip stared at him placidly as he answered the call. A woman’s voice was heard on the other end of the line, “Philip, I heard from Samson. Grandpa also sent me a message just now. I… I want to beg you…</p>  <p id = > please leave us a way out.” Silence. Philip said indifferently, “Jess, I’ll give you two options. First, save the Yates. Second, become Buffer’s student.”</p>  <p id = > Jess was the only person in the Yates family who had treated Wynn and Philip well, so Philip had not planned to attack her from the beginning.</p>  <p id = > However, Jess was now begging him to let the Yates off. She only had one option, and she had to make a choice. Sure enough, Jess fell silent for a long while before finally replying, “I choose to save the Yates.” “Okay,” Philip responded and hung up the phone. With his eyes on Bob who was now trembling, Philip said coldly, “On Jess’s account, the Yates family will not</p>  <p id = > be destroyed. However, don’t even think about making a comeback. From now on, not a single member of the Yates family will enter Riverdale. I don’t want to lay eyes on any one of you ever again, otherwise, don’t blame me for being ruthless!” With that said, Philip no longer looked at Bob who was still kneeling and kowtowing on the ground. Instead, he opened the door and stepped out of the house. Outside the house, Wynn and the others were waiting anxiously. Seeing Philip come out unscathed, Wynn breathed</p> <p id = > a sigh of relief. She ran over and hugged Philip while crying, “Don’t leave me alone again. I can share the weight of the burdens that you have.” Philip returned her hug and said with a smile, “Okay.” On the other hand, Martha rushed into the house anxiously and saw her elderly father kneeling on the ground. She screeched, “Philip Clarke, what did you do to my father! You good-for-nothing piece of trash!”</p>
